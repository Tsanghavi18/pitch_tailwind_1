Can I still apply?","description":"Absolutely! While the Pitch application is written mostly with Clojure, we use lots of more widely-known libraries and languages (e.g. React.js) as well. Every engineer who joins without prior knowledge of Clojure can expect extensive mentorship, time, and resources to learn Clojure and our codebase before diving into the deep-end."},{"heading":"I am based in insert any country here - can I still apply?","description":"Yes, of course. Pitch wants to hire the best and brightest regardless of where they're based geographically. On occasion, teams have a preference for candidates whose working hours overlap with the rest of their team, but there is always flexibility."},{"heading":"Your headquarters are in Berlin - will I need to relocate to work at Pitch?","description":"No. While we do have an office in Berlin, physical presence there is 100% optional."},{"heading":"None of the open positions listed match my skills or interests? Can I send through a speculative application?","description":"Absolutely, feel free to [submit a speculative application](mailto:pitch-software@jobs.workablemail.com)."}]},{"heading":"After applying","questions":[{"heading":"When can I expect to hear back after applying?","description":"We do our best to get back to all applicants within one week of their applications. That being said, the application review process has lots of moving parts and depends on the availability of our hiring teams, holidays, and other unpredictable factors. We do our best, but appreciate your patience if it takes \u003e1 week to respond to you."},{"heading":"Should I expect tailored feedback if my application gets rejected?","description":"Given the high volume of applications we receive, it's not possible for us to give tailored feedback to candidates who aren't selected for first-stage interviews. If you do progress beyond the first-stage interview, however, we try to give specific, tailored feedback should there not be a fit."},{"heading":"How many stages are there to a typical interview process? How much time will I need to invest?","description":"The typical Pitch interview processes consists of the following steps, all of which are conducted remotely.\n1. Introductory call with a member of our Talent Acquisition team.\n2. Interview with 1-2 future team members\n3. Take-home practical assignment.\n4. Follow-up de-brief and Q\u0026A on practical assignment with your future team-mates.\n5. Final call with a senior leader in your team's area (e.g. CTO, VP Design, VP Sales, etc.)"},{"heading":"What happens with my personal data if my application is rejected?","description":"We process and store all data in accordance with GDPR standards. You can request to have your data deleted at any time after applying and we will action this request within 1-2 days."},{"heading":"What is the average duration of the recruitment process at Pitch?","description":"The average recruitment process lasts between 4-5 weeks to get through all the stages, although there's some variability depending on availability on both the hiring team and candidate side."}]},{"heading":"Working at Pitch","questions":[{"heading":"Pitch talks a lot about remote-work, but a lot of your employees seem to be based in Europe. Will I be at a disadvantage if I work for Pitch from outside of Europe?","description":"The short answer is 'no'. We practice asynchronous communication."},{"heading":"What does 100% remote look like for Pitch?","description":"Yes, one might miss having the office as an anchor, or the occasional water-cooler chat with colleagues. But 100% remote work doesn't have to be disengaged and disconnected! At Pitch, we put a lot of emphasis on connecting (not just about work!) through virtual coffee chats, catch-ups via Zoom (as and when needed)... and Slack shenanigans. Additionally, we are big fans of team offsites, yearly company get togethers, and Weekly Bulletins (our async alternative to All-Hands). We believe remote working empowers you to work autonomously and flexibly on something you believe in, and your colleagues are only a Slack away for a second opinion, cheering up, and various meme shenanigans."}]}]},"navigation":{"logoLabel":"Pitch","ctaLabel":"Sign up","ctaUrl":"https://app.pitch.com/?signup","loginLabel":"Log in ","loginUrl":"https://app.pitch.com/?login=true","navigationItems":[{"text":"Product","url":"/product","highlights":[{"text":"Product Overview","url":"/product","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1699605279/website-assets/navigation/Pitch_2.0_nav_menu_image_2.png","description":"See how Pitch works and explore features"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Discover Pitch","links":[{"text":"What’s New","url":"/whats-new"},{"text":"Integrations","url":"/integrations"},{"text":"Presentation Gallery","url":"/presentations"},{"text":"Download","url":"/download"},{"text":"Status","url":"https://status.pitch.com/"}]}]},{"text":"Use Cases","url":"/teams","highlights":[{"text":"Pitch for Teams","description":"Explore how your whole team can use Pitch","url":"/teams","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1721897704/website-assets/navigation/menu-teams.png"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Teams","links":[{"text":"Agencies","url":"/teams/agencies"},{"text":"Sales","url":"/teams/sales"},{"text":"Success","url":"/teams/customer-success"},{"text":"Marketing","url":"/teams/marketing"},{"text":"Designers","url":"/teams/design"}]},{"heading":"Decks","links":[{"text":"Presentation Maker","url":"/use-cases/presentation-maker"},{"url":"/use-cases/pitch-decks","text":"Pitch Decks"},{"text":"Sales Decks","url":"/use-cases/sales-decks"},{"text":"Team Meetings","url":"/use-cases/team-meetings"},{"text":"Board Decks","url":"/use-cases/board-decks"}]}]},{"text":"Templates","url":"/templates","highlights":[{"url":"/templates","text":"Presentation Templates","description":"Get 100+ customizable, expert-made designs","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1707410834/Nav_template_callout_1.png"}],"lists":[{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Pitch Decks","url":"/templates/collections/Pitch-deck"},{"text":"Business","url":"/templates/collections/Business"},{"url":"/templates/collections/Sales","text":"Sales"},{"text":"Startups","url":"/templates/collections/Startups"},{"text":"Professional","url":"/templates/collections/Professional"}]},{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Agency","url":"/templates/collections/Agency"},{"text":"Portfolio","url":"/templates/collections/Portfolio"},{"text":"Brand","url":"/templates/collections/Brand"},{"text":"Creative","url":"/templates/collections/Creative"},{"text":"Modern","url":"/templates/collections/Modern"}]},{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Project Plan","url":"/templates/collections/Project-plan"},{"text":"Proposal","url":"/templates/collections/Proposal"},{"text":"Research","url":"/templates/collections/Research"},{"text":"Strategy","url":"/templates/collections/Strategy"},{"text":"Marketing","url":"/templates/collections/Marketing"}]}]},{"text":"Resources","url":"/blog","highlights":[{"text":"Blog","url":"/blog","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website/common/navigation/dropdown-blog.png","description":"Discover updates, best practices, and more"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Learn","links":[{"text":"Pitch to Win","url":"/pitch-to-win/2023"},{"text":"Academy","url":"/academy"},{"text":"Presentation Guide","url":"/guides/presentation/structure-your-presentation"},{"text":"Help Center","url":"https://help.pitch.com/en/"}]}]},{"text":"Pricing","url":"/pricing"}],"socials":{"label":"Follow Us","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://www.twitter.com/pitch"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/pitchhq"},{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pitchhq"},{"name":"Instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/PitchHq"}]}},"signUp":{"heading":"Want to get early access and product updates?","success-notice":"Almost finished...

To break free from these constraints, you need technical and design skills — and a lot of time.\n\nOr, at least, that used to be true.\n\nWe’ve rebuilt the medium of presentations from the ground up to enable freedom of expression and creative collaboration. With Pitch, teams can create compelling stories in the blink of an eye, turn static documents into dynamic assets, and literally *see* their ideas succeed.\n\nIn a high-stakes, high-visibility world, we’re giving your ideas a greater chance to connect and come to life.","section-3":"In 2018, a team of eight friends started Pitch with the ambition to raise the value of the world’s ideas — and to make work more fun. These principles guide everything we build, and how we work together to this day.\n\nOur roots are in Berlin, and in our attention to detail and quality, we’re proudly “Made in Germany.” But our presence is global: We’re a remote-first company, so you can be a part of our team and use our tool from anywhere."},"founders":{"people":[{"name":"Adam Renklint","role":"Founder \u0026

That’s why we created the [Inclusion at Work collection](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Inclusion-at-Work-3AAUoD44Cd874H7f2C52coBn). This collection of resources was built by, with, and for LGBTQIA+ professionals to help companies avoid reinventing the wheel or repeating mistakes. It highlights thoughtful initiatives that make everyone feel more included and safe at work. \n\nPitch focused on the LGBTQIA+ community as a way to start conversations on underrepresented identities during Pride Month. Here, we're presenting the collection under three guiding principles:\n\n1. Get used to (re)learning\n2. Build processes with diversity in mind\n3. Commit to inclusion at work\n\nUse these initiatives as a springboard, whether you’re looking for inspiration for your startup’s new diversity and inclusion training program or are at a global company and just want to help colleagues get up to speed. We're also sharing a variety of [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) that you can use to create your own resources on these topics — and help keep the conversation going.\n\n## Get used to (re)learning\n\nThe best teams are made up of diverse talent. To effectively work together, team members need to be aware of one another’s unique needs and perspectives. Need a quick explainer on disability, gender, or neurodiversity? Want to understand a particular letter in the LGBTQIA+ acronym? Browse and share the decks below to get everyone on the same page.\n\n### LGBTQIA+ definitions\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/cd1323a9-888f-41fe-9b53-9d90c14cd351\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhat does LGBTQIA+ stand for? What’s the right acronym, and why? This simple deck by Ellen Wagner, the founder of [cross cultural bridges](https://pitch.com/u/crossculturalbridges), is an easy way to get started. Its 14 slides can help you navigate what different terms might (or might not) mean for the people who use them. \n\n*Wake up your audience with the bright illustrations in this [free presentation template](https://pitch.com/templates/Lucid-3SM59m4ud7C954Vdd20mhsUx) created by [Acreb Studio](https://pitch.com/u/acrebstudio).*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/53554ed5-d198-44f2-8cb4-80bc6c82adff\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNow that you have your definitions down, it’s time to broaden the discussion. [Sandra Camacho](https://pitch.com/u/sandrabydesign)’s deck untangles sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Focusing on one concept per slide, it answers questions people may have about terms like gender identity or intersectionality. Skip the hours of research, and use this deck to elevate the conversation level from the get-go.\n\n*Highlight your key ideas and demonstrate your process with this sophisticated [slide deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Demo-6gXTPr2hMAM34ojxLE5vPKDg).*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9e698ed6-b81d-4bc1-a609-e9428219f9e2\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOnce you’ve gotten a hang of the concepts, why not take a quick quiz? See if you can identify all the flags in this deck prepared by [Mimi and Coco](https://pitch.com/u/mimicocoprideco), and then explain the nuances to others.\n\n*Lighten up difficult conversations with the emojis and illustrations in [this template](https://pitch.com/templates/Conference-Presentation-Bold-69F8is0Mobky57mj4v3grQJB) — or with any of our free [sticker packs](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4319772-add-and-edit-shapes-and-stickers).*\n\n### Listen to underrepresented individuals\n\nWhile definitions help us understand people, they don't define them. Often, it’s best to simply pass the mic. That’s why we’ve included the voices of LGBTQIA+ individuals. Play through the slide decks below to hear what queer professionals have to say about their experiences — and what would make their lives and work easier.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/57bc89ed-e4bb-45b8-9fdd-161ff3da8002\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Katrina Strohl](https://pitch.com/u/katrinastrohl)’s presentation on intersectional identities explains how people’s various identities affect their individual experiences. Our identities are tied up with things like gender, race, and disability — but they also include factors we don’t often consider, such as marital status and religion.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/aeaf69e9-4fba-4205-b440-e62ea4696523\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Ghonche Tavoosi](https://pitch.com/u/glenatavoosi)’s recorded presentation shows how individual experiences are actually a problem at scale. As a product manager, Ghonche gives tips on how tech companies can build more inclusive product features that help businesses reach a wider user base. \n\n*Create your own [slide deck with recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) to deliver a perfectly paced story and win over your audience. See how video recordings can be placed throughout a presentation with [this template](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge).*\n\n## Build processes with diversity in mind\n\nBy factoring in the perspectives and experiences of people with different backgrounds, companies can rethink how they value talent, work together, and tackle product development. Inclusion isn’t a checklist — it’s a continuously evolving approach to collaboration. This requires questioning default ways of working that may exclude people outside an ideal norm.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/20b008e3-7e02-4aa2-b9e8-60c8e8f7b925\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt might sound obvious, but hiring is a good place to start. By working to reduce unconscious biases at a foundational level, companies can attract and retain people who think or act in ways they aren’t familiar with. We created this deck to outline the principles that guide our approach to screening. Discover how to identify whether candidates truly have the qualities you’re looking for — or whether your unconscious biases are pulling the strings.\n\n*An element of play can help people digest more sensitive topics. The 3D illustrations in [this template](https://pitch.com/templates/Pitch-4HLuDH4VveRR5iNdtx3rAHUX) will lend your next presentation a sense of “we’re in this together” comradery.*\n\nWant more inspiration on how to create inclusive products? Check out this deck on [inclusive product management](https://pitch.com/presentations/Inclusive-product-management-4cFwij5XQEdJ4PTNdA6Tgirb) (in German) by Karla Schönicke, the founder of Women CTO Dinner, and this deck on [colorblind accessibility](https://pitch.com/presentations/Why-you-should-care-about-colorblind-accessibility-0nBUZk0LwZzu59DG1H4zeiUH) by Colorblind Manifesto. \n\n## Commit to inclusion at work\n\nWe all know that actions speak louder than words. Then again, making a suggestion is easy — building a habit is a whole different ball game. Taking individual inclusivity initiatives, scaling them throughout a company, and holding people accountable can be challenging. It involves identifying discrimination, speaking up, and separating performative allyship from true solidarity. But committing to inclusion at work isn’t complicated.\n\n### Practicing allyship at the individual level\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/f4d87be4-45b1-45f6-92af-01aec003ab16\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nLooking for ways to support queer or other underrepresented communities? [Cathrine Hansen](https://pitch.com/u/cathrinemh), who started by volunteering at Shanghai Pride, shares how she stumbled from one allyship opportunity to the next. For some quick, actionable advice, check out slides 15 to 18.\n\n*Embedding [video recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) keeps your slides clean and your audience engaged. Add dynamism and personality to your next presentation with this [async pitch deck template](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Pitch-Deck-4eZnrJ38hgp65jWXha4xdJFp).*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/f219c756-8ada-4e8c-8782-5675dc70ea7a\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn this deck, [Katharina and Hichem](https://pitch.com/u/kathaandhichem) — colleagues at an NGO supporting migrant communities — discuss how inclusion is a collective action. Creating an inclusive work environment involves changes on the organizational level, but it starts with cultivating self-awareness and empathy as an individual.\n\n*Sometimes the simplest decks deliver the most impact. Ensure you’re getting your point across with this [team meeting template](https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Meeting-45H2Kk3yQrjX4R4aie6gxWZ2).*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/97d9b70f-c6d2-4cec-8a93-a8629d37c889\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother way to make space for people is to see them as they want to be seen. It’s important to respect and use people’s preferred pronouns — whether it’s he/him, he/they, or neopronouns. Check out the deck that our colleague [Rey (they/them)](https://pitch.com/u/ada) put together to learn more.\n\n*Use colorful visuals to convey your message with [this free template](https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Bulletin-4LHZR30w7ycz4dfQZK0cJtae).*\n\n### Helping underrepresented professionals succeed\n\nIt’s not enough to talk about marginalized identities at a meeting — people from different backgrounds need to be in the meeting and actively involved in shaping decisions. And for this to happen, individuals who are firsts or onlys in a company need support.\n\nFor example, marginalized individuals shouldn’t always be expected to represent their community. In fact, underrepresented people need to [set boundaries to protect their peace](https://pitch.com/presentations/Protecting-your-peace-at-work-4RuEbL3TzCCb4NwQd70JNdQA). In those moments, colleagues with more power and privilege can step up and flex their [allyship](https://guidetoallyship.com/) muscle to nurture a thriving and resilient team culture.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/73cd142d-1b1c-41bd-af3c-282045c6400e\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYoung professionals require support and mentorship to succeed. [Céline Dedaj](https://pitch.com/u/celinededaj) prepared a slide deck to help LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented professionals create a supportive workplace network — but anyone in leadership can use it as a blueprint to build a mentorship or sponsorship program for junior hires.\n\n*Have a bold vision? Create your own [slide deck with this cyberpunk-themed template](https://pitch.com/templates/Cyberpunk-2XjVgD2XJQ6F4VemW36PWepm).*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/1d638698-44ae-44e4-8d8a-4bea54ca4281\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAlso, watch out for tokenization and pinkwashing. Asking someone to take on a temporary leadership role or create a diversity and inclusion statement for Pride Month is an empty gesture. Simply copying public inclusion checklists without reflecting on the topics may also do more harm than good. Instead, individuals committed to inclusion can focus on mindset shifts that lead to concrete actions in everything from product design to company policies.\n\n*Get internal stakeholders on board with this [workshop slide deck theme](https://pitch.com/templates/Workshop-4RZSj72xM7JY4iYJmw2VJ1XB), and engage your audience using [live video collaboration](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4520554-collaborate-on-slides-via-live-video).*\n\n### Formalizing an inclusive culture\n\nIf you’ve already created an environment where different types of colleagues feel safe and valued at work, it’s time to formalize your culture.

In their words, “Anything that’s cute enough can get adopted!”\n\n## Taking solid steps toward inclusion\n\nIn today’s world, there’s a [clear business case](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters) for diversity and inclusion. The hesitancy hurdle remains because companies and individuals who care want to do things right. Inclusion isn’t a status — it’s a process of continuous learning. By exploring the topics that LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented professionals have highlighted as important, sharing their decks, and starting initiatives in your company, you can take concrete steps toward building a more inclusive culture.\n\n### Get started with free presentation templates\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Prisma-2BvhdQ2WEbr55Lf99n5TmNKi\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1663260072/blog/13%20decks%20for%20inclusive%20tech%20culture%20/Prisma_deck.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Consulting-Proposal-52Nh2S79mYTX4QmmGf08WM1c\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1663260151/blog/13%20decks%20for%20inclusive%20tech%20culture%20/Consulting_Proposal.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:See more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"15 great pitch deck examples from successful startups","visible-title":"15 great pitch deck examples from successful startups","date":"2022-07-19T08:11:45.009Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Athena Lam","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995744/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Header_MOBILE_15_great_pitch_decks_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995741/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Header_SMALL_15_great_pitch_decks_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995744/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Header_MID_15_great_pitch_decks_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995746/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Header_BIG_15_great_pitch_decks_w1920.png","image-description":"Examples of startup pitch decks from Front, Lago, Dearest, Hello Inside, Nylas, clare\u0026me, Perfeggt, and Beelinguapp","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995739/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_15_great_pitch_decks.png","thumbnail-description":"Examples of startup pitch decks from Front, Lago, Dearest, Hello Inside, Nylas, clare\u0026me, Perfeggt, and Beelinguapp","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655995744/blog/15%20great%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Social_share_15_great_pitch_decks.png","meta-image-description":"","tweet-text":"","teaser-text":"Get inspiration for your pitch deck from these seed to Series C-stage startups that have successfully fundraised since 2020!","excerpt":"You have a brilliant idea that’s going to change the world.

Luckily, with the help of my team, I overcame my junior jitters and gained confidence in my new role. Here’s my advice for folks starting their careers in tech.\n\nTransitioning from college to a work environment was a big adjustment. With my computer science degree in hand, I knew I wanted to become a software engineer, but when I got the job at Pitch, self-doubt hit me:\n\nWas I really ready? \n\nWhat’s expected of me as a junior team member? \n\nWhat if I break stuff? \n\nWhat if I don’t succeed? \n\nHow do you really use git, anyway? \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662459367/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Seb_thought_bubbles_w1200.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nI had a serious case of imposter syndrome. I was looking forward to getting started, but the thought of joining a team of highly experienced software engineers — who were working on a product used by tens of thousands of teams — was daunting. \n\nWhen I got started, I decided to be open about how I was feeling. It was tough to admit how little I knew about software development in practice. But my new colleagues were incredibly receptive, and they all pitched in to help ease my transition. \n\nI realized that it wasn’t my job to know everything, but to learn. In that spirit, here are three things I’ve learned so far about what it takes to hit your stride in your first job in tech.\n\n## Ask lots of questions — and ask them publicly\n\nSoon after joining Pitch in August 2020, I realized I had a lot to learn about how software is built collaboratively by teams of engineers. College prepared me for writing code, but not for shipping software in a product team. I didn't know how to create a pull request, or what it meant to review someone else’s code. \n\nAt first, I was worried that others would find out how little I knew. I was afraid of asking questions because I didn’t want to sound incompetent or naive. But after some reflection, I realized that pretending I knew things wouldn’t get me far. \n\nI stopped trying to figure everything out by myself, and started speaking up when I didn’t know things. \n\nI stopped pinging people privately, and started asking questions in public Slack channels. \n\nIn short, I stopped hiding my inexperience, and started embracing it.\n\nMy new approach helped me find the answers I was seeking. But just as importantly, it brought me a broader range of perspectives — not just from my manager, but from the entire engineering team. I also found that asking a question publicly opened doors to new topics I hadn’t discovered yet. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1662459372/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/inline-image-pitch-junior-jitters-slack-thread.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662627086/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Scrolling_animation_Slack_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nA few months in, I felt my growth start to accelerate, and I began getting shout-outs from colleagues: \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1662459366/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Praise_for_Seb_on_Slack_w1200.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662627086/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Praise_for_Seb_on_Slack_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAsking questions in public didn’t just teach me the basics of building software as a team at Pitch. It was also the key to learning Clojure — the language most of our codebase is written in.  My change in approach massively helped my progress in just about every way. So I’d encourage any other growth-minded junior engineer to stop hiding, and start asking. \n\n## Learn to manage up\n\nWhen you’re just starting out in tech, it’s natural to assume that your manager will tell you what to do and how to improve. I assumed that myself, but I’ve since changed my view. \n\nA good manager does provide guidance and mentorship. But I learned that if you really want to flourish, you need to take ownership of your personal growth by making your development a two-way conversation.\n\nEven in relatively small teams of engineers, a manager has many different responsibilities (and other people to manage), so it's up to you to help them help you grow. Reading First Round Review's [A Tactical Guide to Managing Up](https://review.firstround.com/a-tactical-guide-to-managing-up-30-tips-from-the-smartest-people-we-know) really shed some light on this for me.\n\nIn my first few weekly one-on-one meetings with my manager, Oskar, I expected him to lead the conversation and tell me what to focus on. But after reading about managing up, I changed my approach. \n\nI created a shared document, and before each one-on-one, I wrote down topics I wanted to discuss. I outlined how I wanted to spend my time in a given week, what was blocking my work, questions I had, and where I wanted to grow. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/7de4d3e4-2907-4fac-973e-af5fc854aae9\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:We like to adapt this template for 1:1s on my team at Pitch.] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe like to adapt this template for 1:1s on my team at Pitch.\n\nThese preparations really raised the quality of my relationship with Oskar — they made it much easier for him to give me feedback and help me where I needed help. Our discussions became ten times more productive, and how we worked together improved a lot.\n\n## Become an expert in a topic, even if it’s not flashy\n\nAt Pitch, we help new joiners get the hang of our codebase and workflows by having them work on smaller tweaks, improvements, and bug fixes before they take ownership of big features. \n\nMy own first tasks were focused on small improvements to the user onboarding flow. It wasn’t the flashiest part of our product, but I was really excited to work on something that’s touched by every single new user. After I’d spent a few weeks making these small improvements and fixes, I was assigned my first big feature: passwordless authentication. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1662459366/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Passwordless_auth_flow_w1200.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662627086/blog/beating-junior-jitters-when-starting-in-tech/Inline_image_Passwordless_auth_flow_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPasswordless authentication lets you sign up for Pitch with a simple one-time code — no long, complicated passwords necessary. Cool, right?\n\nTackling this feature just a few months in was challenging for me, but I got an up-close look at our authentication flow and at how users get started with Pitch. By the time the feature finally shipped, I’d gained a deep knowledge of our onboarding flow. This proved invaluable as I moved on to build many other onboarding features. \n\nIt felt great to become an expert on a topic — and to be relied on by my teammates for the expertise I’d developed.\n\n## A never-ending learning journey\n\nThese days, I’m not so junior anymore. I’m tackling more advanced technical features. I’m also contributing my expertise to a new team that’s helping Pitch grow by making it easy for users to get started, invite teammates, and share their work.\n\nReflecting on my earliest days at Pitch, I now realize that I put too much pressure on myself. Pitch didn’t hire me because of how much I knew — I was hired because of my capacity to learn and grow. To this day, I still consider this my most important skill set. \n\nIn that sense, starting my first job as a software engineer wasn’t a transition at all. It was a continuation of the learning journey I’d been on since kindergarten. It’s been a rewarding adventure so far. And as long as I stay open to learning and growing, I’m sure the future has plenty more in store for me."},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch","Presentation Resources"],"title":"3 ways we use Pitch \u0026 Notion as a remote team","date":"2021-06-02T15:21:46.322Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Aimee Millwood","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/notion_Header_MOBILE__w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/notion_Header_SMALL__w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/notion_Header_MID__w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/1600x1200_notion.jpg","image-description":"Notion-Pitch-remote-work","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/notion_Cover_thumbnail_420x300.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/notion_Social_share.jpg","teaser-text":"Notion and Pitch together are a powerful duo.

We repurposed Excel to help us with project management, used Google Docs to keep running lists of tasks and due dates, and relied on outdated presentation software to help us share our thinking with others. \n\nBut in recent years, all that has changed. Rather than change the way we work to fit with the capabilities of the tools we use, we're building tools that work the way we need them to. Now that we no longer have to struggle to do our daily tasks, we can find ways to build on top of our modern toolstack so that 1+1=3.\n\n## How we use Notion \u0026 Pitch together\n\nFrom the beginning, we at Pitch have been huge fans of [Notion](http://notion.so/). Like us, they’re a new type of software, ones that are built for people who care about using tools that not only empower their work but are fun and delightful to use. \n\nWe’ve written before about how we use Notion as a “single source of truth” to house our internal documentation. It’s become an indispensable tool that powers our design processes, product teams, and project management. And Notion and Pitch together are a powerful duo. \n\nWe’re big proponents of having a single source of truth, but we also know different truths need different tools. There are times when the information we need to show is better suited for slides, and others when the best format is a deep dive Notion page. From weekly team updates to quarterly roadmap planning, here are three ways we use Pitch and Notion to work better as a remote team. \n\n## Use case #1: Project management\n\nProject managers need to be able to zoom in and zoom out. They need to see the big picture to understand where everything stands, but they also need to be able to dig into the details. \n\nWhether a quarterly roadmap or ongoing production workflow, this is where Pitch and Notion’s synergy really shines. Presentations are great for visualizing timelines, milestones, and other progress points, but these often need to be broken down into more concrete roadmaps and task lists. \n\nWe use Notion to zoom in, and Pitch to zoom out. With Pitch, we can show where the project stands as a whole, and then we link out to the relevant pages in Notion so the right stakeholders can get a better grasp on all the moving pieces. \n\nFor example, in our weekly template production sync, we meet using live video collaboration in Pitch to review the high-level progress on our production pipeline. The slide then links out to our more detailed roadmaps in Notion, which offer a step-by-step view of where any given template sits in the pipeline.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Pitch_01062021.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/fallback_notion.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis ensures our team has a shared view of progress, and that each individual member has the right level of detail. Not everyone needs to know the status of each and every task, but most stakeholders want to get an at-a-glance understanding of the overall progress of a project. Using Pitch and Notion together allows us to give an overview to those who need it, while still offering an opportunity to drill down to those who are interested. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nWe use Notion to zoom in, and Pitch to zoom out.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe built Pitch to handle many types of embedded media, so it's no surprise that it's one of the things we love most about Notion too. By embedding Pitch presentations directly into Notion, people viewing a project page in Notion can easily scan through related decks. \n\n*[Learn more about embedding Pitch presentations here.](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4190836-how-to-embed-a-presentation)*\n\n## Use case #2: Recurring team updates\n\nMeetings and emails aren’t always the ideal format for sharing updates. You can only put so much into an email before it becomes too long, and the time-bound nature of meetings means you’re forced to edit or cut out information. But the combination of Pitch and Notion helps us present information in a flexible format, allowing us to highlight key points while also offering space for deeper explorations. \n\nNotion and Pitch really deliver for us when it comes to updates we need to create and share on an ongoing basis, like monthly all-hands, weekly huddles, or daily team standups.\n\nOne of our most common use cases for sharing updates is our [weekly team bulletin](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins). In it, each team gives a high-level overview of what they’re working on that week and then links out to Notion pages that contain more information for people who’d like a more detailed look. \n\nFor example, a product team may share a new feature they’re working on in the bulletin, and then use the slide to link out to more documentation or a video explainer. Or a project manager could use the bulletin to provide a quick status update, and then link out to the full project plan in Notion.\n\nThe asynchronous nature of bulletins means everyone has time to thoughtfully consume and comment on ongoing work across the company. People can skim through the slides with their Monday morning coffee, and click through to the relevant Notion pages to get more information on the updates that interest them. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/ac0e268f-890a-45eb-a3ef-045ba8ea26f7?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n*Want to know more about bulletins? We wrote a whole post on how we use weekly team bulletins at Pitch — [check it out](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins).*\n\n## Use case #3: Enhancing the remote employee onboarding experience\n\nWe’ve always been remote-friendly, but like many other companies, the pandemic gave us a reason to take a look at how remote-optimized our internal processes were. Part of this meant considering how new employees digest the information they receive in their first days of joining our company. \n\nFor employees that join remotely, our internal tools are their main touchpoints with the company. While Slack is great for staying up-to-date on recent, ongoing conversations, it’s not always the right medium for new team members who may not know what they’re looking for (or where to look). \n\nAt Pitch, we use Notion as the hub for important information for new employees (like how to take days off, how to set up software, etc.). Notion is the ideal place to store this information because anyone can update the pages as needed, and new employees can feel free to leave comments and questions, tagging teammates depending on what they need. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Small_image_w800_-_Empoyee_FAQ_notion_2021.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOne of our favorite parts of this page is our employee directory. Whenever someone new starts, they create a page with their name, title, photo, and a little bit about themselves. They can also link out to their social profiles or personal websites. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Article_Visual_-_1600_px-1_1.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhile Notion houses all of our important employee information, functioning as a sort of continuously updated employee handbook, we also create unique onboarding decks for each employee. These are tailored to their team and feature just the information they need to do their work efficiently. \n\nOften, new employees are inundated with an overload of information, so creating a short deck helps us highlight just the most important information for them. And of course, these inevitably link back to Notion pages where employees can get more info on specific topics.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9621f898-360c-454d-99f7-ed1c40e22117?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Notion \u0026 Pitch: Greater than the sum of the parts\n\nThese are just a few of the ways we use Notion and Pitch for internal documentation and knowledge sharing, but we’re always stumbling upon new ways we can do more by using our tools together. Do you have creative examples for how you’re using Pitch and Notion together? We’d love to hear!\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["News","Product Updates"],"title":"60+ product updates: Q1 in review","date":"2021-04-08T08:11:05.870Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Header_MOBILE_Q1_review_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Header_SMALL_Q1_review_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Header_MID_Q1_review_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Header_BIG_Q1_review_w1920.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Q1_review.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Social_share_Q1_review.jpg","teaser-text":"Since January, we’ve shipped 13 new features and 50+ improvements.

By October, more than 25,000 teams were working in Pitch. After reflecting on our launch we entered the new year with one clear focus: Make it simple for teams to get started with Pitch. \n\nSince January, we’ve shipped 13 new features and 55 improvements that make creating and collaborating on decks fast and easy. Check out the latest updates and see why it’s never been a better time to get your team on board.  \n\n## Make the switch to Pitch faster\n\nWhen teams have a central space to work they can accomplish anything — from [raising money](https://pitch.com/blog/how-yac-raised-7-5-million-using-pitch) to [delivering more customer-centric products](https://pitch.com/blog/feedly-pitch-case-study). But getting teams to change their ways of working can be tough, even when the benefits outweigh the temporary discomfort of doing things differently.\n\nSo this quarter, we set out to make it easy for teams to get started, migrate over their existing materials, and create beautiful decks quicker than ever.\n\n### Explore the template gallery \n\nWe get a lot of love for our professionally designed presentation templates. But until recently, they were only available once you joined a workspace. This quarter, [we made our template gallery public](https://pitch.com/templates), enabling anyone to draw inspiration from more than 50 well-crafted templates. \n\nOur template team is growing and working to add more business-ready templates to the gallery. But we’re also on the lookout for [stellar presentations](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips) from the community. Interested in submitting?

Our PowerPoint importer, now in beta, streamlines the process of migrating your work into Pitch. \n\nUpload a .pptx file — even if it was originally created in Keynote or Google Slides — to import your slides, text, shapes, images, and more. Take an extra minute to upload your fonts and adjust your presentation style to optimize your deck for Pitch. We have a dedicated team working to improve our PowerPoint importer each week — be sure to share your feedback on the beta and follow our [What’s New page](https://pitch.com/whats-new) for the latest updates.\n\n### Enjoy an improved editing experience\n\nBuilding a new product means balancing innovation and foundation. After all, there are lots of small things presentation software needs to do to support your everyday work. \n\nThis quarter we shipped dozens of quality-of-life updates to speed up your workflow and tap into your inner designer. For instance: \n\n* **Edit text and images like a pro:** We gave our editor some love, replacing sliders with input fields, adding font search, and making it easier to resize and crop images. \n* **Create slick-looking charts in a few clicks:** We shipped new chart types, legends, and multi-chart styling to make designing with data a breeze. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/2_Big_image_Q1review_w1200.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Get the guide on getting started \n\nIn addition to product improvements, we also compiled our top tips into a sharable guide on making the switch to Pitch. [Get the guide here.](https://pitch.com/blog/switch-to-pitch)\n\n## Work across a variety of devices\n\nWork happens wherever you are — it isn’t limited to the office or a laptop. Early in Pitch’s journey, we set the technical foundation for cross-platform support, enabling us to offer Pitch on the web, Windows, and macOS from the very beginning. This quarter, we started exploring new platforms and devices. \n\n### Review slides on the go with Pitch for iOS (beta) \n\nIn February, our iPhone app entered beta, enabling teams to review slides, give feedback, and keep working moving forward — no matter where they are. \n\nWith Pitch for iOS, you can browse folders, open presentations, and scroll through slides in portrait or landscape mode. In addition to reviewing and responding to comments, we’ve infused the app with some of the workflow options that make working in Pitch efficient and delightful. Assign a slide to delegate work to a teammate, set a slide status to confirm a slide is approved, or add an emoji reaction to share quick feedback. \n\nWe’re still looking for more enthusiastic beta testers. [Fill out this form to join the beta](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Uq1sQ2ln).\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/3_Q1review_Small_image_w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Build decks blazingly fast on Apple silicon\n\nMost of the Pitch team uses Macbooks for our day-to-day work. When Apple introduced its M1 chips late last year, we were eager to get our hands on the new Macbooks to experience the performance upgrades firsthand. Excited by the possibilities, we wanted to make sure our desktop app was set up to take full advantage of Apple silicon. \n\nIf you’re using a Mac running on Apple silicon, Pitch for macOS is simply the fastest way to create stunning presentations. [Download it here](https://pitch.com/download) and see for yourself. \n\n## Unlock new ways to work with others\n\nWhether you’re working with your internal team or external partners or customers, it’s simple to create, share, and get feedback on your ideas. \n\n### View and manage guests in one place\n\nThe need to collaborate isn’t limited to your immediate team. That’s why Pitch workspaces support members and guests. Members can view, edit, and create presentations in the workspace, while guests can view and edit specific presentations, but can’t browse the workspace.\n\nBefore, guests were only visible from individual presentations, making it difficult to get an overall picture of who could access content in your workspace. \n\nIn March, we introduced a centralized view of guests. Go to **Workspace members** to see a list of all guests who can view or edit presentations in your workspace or private folders. From there, you can update or revoke their access or promote guests to members. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/5_Q1review_Small_image_w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Follow collaborators to work more efficiently\n\nReal-time editing has always been a point of pride for us. At the end of last year, we introduced live video collaboration and live cursors to make co-editing seamless and fun. With live video, we were able to support new use cases like team meetings and workshops, hosted right from the editor. But keeping teams on the same slide required active engagement from participants. \n\nNow, you can click on an editor's avatar and follow them through a deck while they switch slides and make edits. When used with live video collaboration, it’s easy to run a meeting or workshop and keep everyone focused on the right content. If you have multiple moderators, you can quickly change who you’re following — just click on the new moderator’s avatar. We’ve been dogfooding this for team meetings, brainstorms, and leadership offsites, and it’s greatly improved the virtual meeting experience. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Big_Video_FollowCollaborators_sfcagf.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/4_Q1Review_Big_image_w1200.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Q2 preview: Collaborate confidently\n\nOver the next few months, we’ll be focused on helping highly collaborative teams get more value out of Pitch. Here are some of the updates you can look forward to over the next few weeks. \n\n* **See all notifications in one place:** Check your workspace for a new notification center. Now, when someone mentions you in a comment or assigns a slide to you, you’ll be able to find out right away in Pitch.\n* **Know who’s viewed your work:** Soon, Pro members will be able to see when other editors have viewed their presentations. This represents our first step toward granular presentation analytics, and we expect to share more updates here throughout the quarter. \n* **Review and recover previous slide versions:** The creative process gets messy sometimes. Soon, you’ll be able to recover deleted slides or browse previous versions to ensure great ideas don’t get lost. \n\nEvery week, we share all the need-to-know updates in our release notes.

Since July, we’ve shipped 16 features and 53 improvements to help teams of all sizes create and collaborate more effectively. \n\nHere’s an overview of some key updates we shipped, how to get involved in our upcoming betas, and what we’ll be working on throughout the rest of the year.\n\n## **Create faster with new assets and editor improvements**\n\nHelping teams deliver better presentations faster remains a core focus for us. Over the past three months, we’ve shipped new templates, integrations, and ease-of-use improvements to spark your inspiration and add more flexibility in how you present your work. \n\n#### Choose from [18 new templates](https://pitch.com/templates)\n\nDelivering a successful presentation starts with finding the right inspiration. Our new templates are here to support you across key work topics, like business plans, go-to-market strategies, communications plans, and investor reports. (And of course you’ll find a couple [new pitch deck templates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck) to support you throughout your company’s journey.) \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1633423063/blog/1_Q3_roundup_templates__w1200.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith more than 100 templates in our gallery, you’ll always find the perfect starting point for your next presentation. [Check them out here](https://pitch.com/templates).  \n\n#### Add personality to your slides with 3 new sticker packs\n\nWe heard that you love our stickers, but you need even more ways to express yourselves. This quarter, we expanded our sticker library to highlight more artistic styles. **Make your point**, **Craft a plan**, and **Office flashback** offer playful ways to draw attention to your ideas, manage workshops, and more. \n\nYou can expect even more stickers in the months ahead. If you have a style in mind or know an artist we should collaborate with, [let us know](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/vMTNQLhA)! \n\n#### Explore our newest integration\n\nWho loves fiddling with chart formatting? Not us. In August, [we launched our data integration with ChartMogul](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-chartmogul-make-reporting-revenue-easy), making reporting on your recurring revenue metrics easier than ever. Now, instead of painstakingly pasting in data, you can create or update a chart in just a few clicks and seamlessly share the latest data with your team, investors, and other partners. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1633423092/blog/3_ChartMogulWider_1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1633423649/blog/3_ChartMogulWider_1200w-fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’ve also improved the charting experience in Pitch by overhauling the design controls, adding customizable color palettes to the editor, and making our number formatting more intuitive. \n\n#### Quickly style and edit slides\n\nPresentation styles are one of our standout features — but for non-designers, they can be a little intimidating! After extensive [user research](https://pitch.com/blog/why-you-should-develop-features-people-dont-ask-for), we started rolling out updates to make styles more accessible to everyone. We started by renaming them to slide styles, so it was clear that they were applied on a slide-by-slide basis, and that a presentation might contain multiple slide styles. \n\nAlong with that, we redesigned the menu for slide styles, making it easier to understand which styles are in use and change styles across your entire presentation.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1633423094/blog/2_StyleChartChange_1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1633423610/blog/2_StyleChartChange_1200w-fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe also added several ease-of-use improvements to the editor to help you create faster without resorting to workarounds. Now you can hyperlink images, easily resize multiple blocks at once, and more.\n\n#### Enjoy performance improvements across our apps\n\nOur product teams work tirelessly behind the scenes to shave milliseconds off of every interaction. This quarter, they collaborated with our performance team to make our desktop, web, and mobile apps fast and responsive, no matter how big your presentations are. \n\nLaunching the app and navigating between presentations and folders is snappier than ever, we’ve gotten video processing down to five seconds, and we’ve reduced the average size of PDF exports by a whopping 95%. Plus, collaborative editing is smoother than ever, so you can see exactly what others are doing when editing a slide in real time.  \n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e🎮 Multiplayer editing in \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Pitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e@Pitch\u003c/a\u003e just became significantly better – you can now see changes as they’re happening. Plus, collaborators can edit the same block simultaneously. More collaboration improvements are coming soon: next up is text editing. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/aU2p7HKB4J\"\u003epic.twitter.com/aU2p7HKB4J\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Christian Reber (@christianreber) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/christianreber/status/1430218814189412352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eAugust 24, 2021\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n## Stay in sync with collaboration updates\n\nWhether you're back in the office or still repping remote life, the need to collaborate effectively is as important as ever. Our latest updates are designed to help you keep a finger on the pulse of what's happening, work better with external stakeholders, and take your workflow with you. \n\n### Subscribe to presentations\n\nEarlier this year, we shipped our notification center and rolled out our first in-app notifications. But we know there are times you want to follow conversations and progress — even when you’re not explicitly mentioned. Now you can subscribe to any presentation. Once subscribed, you’ll receive notifications when anyone adds a comment or when slides are marked as Done. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1633423096/blog/4_Subscribe_1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1633423561/blog/4_Subscribe_1200w-fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n#### Invite guests to comment on decks\n\nPreviously, there were only two ways to work with people outside your workspace. You could invite them to view your presentation and restrict them from editing or sharing feedback, or you could invite them to edit the presentation and allow them to see everything happening behind the scenes. Both options worked, but lacked some nuance. \n\nAt the end of July, we introduced an in-between option for the times when you want someone’s feedback or approval but still want to place limits on how much they can see and edit. With comment-only access, guests can add comments, assign slides, and change slide statuses, but can’t edit content or invite more collaborators. It’s a great choice for getting client feedback or inviting an executive to Pitch in a more limited way. And remember, Pitch Pros: Guests are free, so you can invite as many people as you want to collaborate on presentations without impacting your monthly bill.  \n\n#### Collaborate from any device\n\nOur iPhone and Android apps entered beta earlier this year, giving teams a convenient way to keep work moving. This quarter, we focused on making Pitch for mobile more collaborative. Now, in addition to reviewing and giving feedback on presentations, you can share presentations with guests and members and even invite new members to join your workspace. \\\n\\\nAs we get closer to launching our iPhone app, we've opened up beta access across both platforms. [Download Pitch for mobile now](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/MTQqMenr#source=xxxxx). \n\n## Participate in upcoming betas\n\nSince the beginning, your feedback has been critical to refining the product experience and informing our roadmap. Now, as Pitch matures, we have several exciting features that require hands-on exploration and feedback before we bring them to the world. \n\nIf you’re the adventurous type, then here’s your chance to [get involved in our upcoming betas](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/ojMGbxae).\n\n#### Analyze public presentation views\n\nWe all want to know when our work’s been seen, right? With public views, you can see how many times a public link or embedded presentation has been viewed. If you’re creating pitch decks, sales decks, or marketing materials in Pitch, public views will offer new insight into your work.\\\n\\\nPublic views represent the next step toward advanced presentation analytics, which will be rolled out incrementally in the coming months. \n\nTesting is currently underway. If you're currently on Pitch Pro, then [reach out to join the beta](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/ojMGbxae). \n\n#### Embed any link on a slide\n\nWe view presentations as living documents — they should be as dynamic and interactive as any of the other ways you collaborate and share ideas. Up until now, our embeds have supported video services like YouTube, Vimeo, and Loom. But many of you want to embed prototypes, forms, social posts, and more. \n\nIn this experimental beta, you’ll be able to embed more types of content on your slides. We’re looking for teams who are willing to get their hands dirty, report bugs, and share feedback with our product teams. If that’s you, [then sign up](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/ojMGbxae) — testing starts in a few weeks!\n\n#### Publish your big ideas on Pitch \n\nIn June, [we debuted our first creator profiles](https://pitch.com/blog/creator-profiles-the-future-of-publishing) and teased the future of publishing on Pitch. We’ve been working to onboard our first creators, but we’re still on the lookout for more storytellers. We’re especially interested in presentations covering topics relevant to growing teams, like fundraising, hiring, marketing, business development, and design.\n\nWhat’s in it for you? In addition to securing your unique handle on Pitch, you’ll have a chance to influence our publishing experience. [Apply to secure your creator profile now](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/EkigJZmG#source=xxxxx\u0026medium=xxxxx\u0026campaign=xxxxx\u0026email=xxxxx). \n\n## One year post-launch: What's next?\n\nIt’s been nearly two years since we entered beta and one year since we launched Pitch to the world. To say this experience has been incredible would be an understatement. Your enthusiasm and willingness to share your feedback — and your work — have been inspiring. \n\nThroughout this journey, we’ve shipped updates nearly [every week](https://pitch.com/blog/every-week): 101 releases as of this week! This regular cadence is the rhythm that drives us.\n\nAs we wind down this year and look toward the future, we remain committed to [realizing our product vision](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-series-b-funding). And a large part of achieving that is ensuring that Pitch continues to be intuitive, fast, and delightful. So, in addition to the beta programs we mentioned, we’ll be spending time refining the foundations of Pitch. That means: \n\n* Tackling technical improvements around the editor\n* Paving the way for must-have (and much-anticipated) features like grouping blocks on a slide \n* Polishing parts of the UI to be clearer and more consistent\n\nSo [follow along](https://pitch.com/whats-new), [be part of the feature development journey](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/ojMGbxae), and connect with like-minded professionals in our [Slack community](https://pitch.com/community)!"},{"type":"blog","category":["News","Product Updates"],"title":"80+ product updates: Q2 in review","date":"2021-07-13T11:27:39.110Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657323/blog/Header_MOBILE_Q2_review_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657326/blog/Header_SMALL_Q2_review_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657324/blog/Header_MID_Q2_review_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657326/blog/Header_BIG_Q2_review_w1920.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657322/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Q2_review.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657325/blog/Social_share_Q2_review.jpg","teaser-text":"Since April, we shipped 32 features and 55 improvements.

Since April, [we raised an $85M Series B](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-series-b-funding), unveiled our product vision, and shipped some significant updates to how teams collaborate and present with Pitch. We also shipped 32 features and 55 improvements. \n\nAfter taking a deeper look into what's most important for our users, we narrowed down our focus to four main themes: Making editing fast and easy, doubling down on collaboration, enhancing how teams consume and present content, and laying the foundation for publishing. Over the past quarter, we've made notable progress in each of those areas. \n\nHere's a recap of the highlights and a sneak peek of what we’ll be focusing on this summer. \n\n## 1. Making editing fast and easy\n\nEveryone should have the tools to create beautiful, effective presentations. Our editing experience combines the best parts of presentation and design tools, so creating in Pitch feels familiar enough to be intuitive, yet powerful enough to inspire new ways to create.\n\nEven more importantly, we want to empower teams to put their time and energy into what matters most — developing their ideas — instead of forcing them to waste time on formatting and finicky edits. So this quarter, we set out to improve the process of working with images, charts, and tables. \n\nVisuals are a central part of any presentation, no matter the topic. We want the process of adding, swapping, and editing images to be as efficient as possible. Over the past few months, we’ve completely rebuilt image cropping. Not only is resizing, repositioning, and replacing super simple, but we’ve even started to enhance this workflow with AI. With smart panning, when you replace an image, Pitch will detect the most prominent part and automatically adjust its position in the frame.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1626085796/blog/Small_image_crop_video__w800.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657729/blog/1_imagecropping_panning_Q2.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOf course, there's more to visuals than just images. If you’re working on more data-driven presentations, you need charts that are easy to work with and can help you conceptualize your most important points. \n\nIn April, [we added several new charts to Pitch](https://pitch.com/whats-new/new-charts-plus-table-resizing). With area charts, it’s easy to highlight trends over time. And with stacked charts, you can compare totals and show the relationship between individual segments. And in June, [we made tables more customizable](https://pitch.com/whats-new/table-styling-refreshed-sharing-and-more). In addition to resizing individual rows and columns, cells can be individually restyled so you can draw attention to important text and numbers.   \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1626096194/blog/Charts_Big_image__w1200.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1626086802/blog/Charts_Big_image__w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 2. Doubling down on collaboration\n\nOur mission is to enable every team’s best thinking. To do that, we have to make it easy for teams to work together and share feedback. Since April, we’ve given collaboration in Pitch a major upgrade. Now you can: \n\n**Get notified about updates right from Pitch.** At the start of the quarter, [we introduced our notification center](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5108435-view-in-app-notifications). Now, you can track slide assignments, comments, and presentation and workspace invites across our web app, desktop apps, and mobile apps. \n\n**View and recover previous slide versions and restore deleted slides.** Who can pass up a bit of time travel? If you’re a Pro user, you can see the entire history of a slide, see who made specific changes, and copy previous versions of slides back into your deck. And since mistakes happen to the best of us, all users can view and restore previously deleted slides. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1625659001/blog/2_VersionHistory_Big_image__w1200.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625726564/blog/2_VersionHistory_Big-image_w1200.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Share presentations on the go.** At the beginning of 2021, our iOS app entered beta. In May, we also released the beta of Pitch for Android. Both enable teams to review slides and share feedback, no matter where they’re working. In June, we added the ability to turn on public access and share presentations using your device’s default sharing options. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1625657738/blog/3_Small_image_MobileShare__w800.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625726563/blog/3_Small-image_MobileShare_w800.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n*Psst! We’re still looking for more enthusiastic beta testers. If you're interested, [fill out this form to join our mobile beta](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Uq1sQ2ln).*\n\n## 3. Enhancing how teams consume and present content\n\nPresentations are an incredibly valuable way to distill information. Whether people are reviewing your presentations asynchronously or you’re presenting live, you want your audience to be able to focus on the content of your message. \n\nIn June, we unveiled a new player. It’s not just a way to present — it’s a whole new way to review work. Whether you're catching up on team updates or giving a sales deck a final spot check, our player offers a focused way to consume presentations without worrying about accidental edits. \n\nIf you’re checking out a teammate’s deck, you can use the player to give your full attention to their work, while also having space to view and add reactions and comments. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1626160700/blog/5_PlayerSpeakerview_Big_image__w1200_-.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625726566/blog/5_PlayerSpeakerview_Big-image_w1200.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnd when you’re ready to present, you can minimize the player controls and open speaker view. This way, you can still see your slides and speaker notes all in one place, while keeping them safely out of your audience’s sight. \n\nOur immersive player experience is also available from public presentations, and will soon be available from presentation embeds. So no matter where and when people review your work, you can be sure it will always look its absolute best. \n\n## 4. Laying the foundation for publishing\n\nOur vision is to build the first complete platform for presentations. In support of that, we’re creating an ecosystem where anyone around the world can publish and exchange presentations and templates. \n\n[In June, we introduced creator profiles](https://pitch.com/blog/creator-profiles-the-future-of-publishing), dedicated pages where creators and brands can showcase their best templates and presentations to the world. \n\nOur first 25 creators are experts across topics like user research, fundraising, sales, and design. You can get to know them and start building with their templates from the [template gallery.](https://pitch.com/templates) \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1625657738/blog/6_creator_profiles_Big_image_w1200__Q2.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn the coming months, we’ll be recruiting new creators to showcase their storytelling skills and establish a professional profile on Pitch. If you’re eager to reserve your handle on Pitch and want to participate in our publishing beta, [you can apply here](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/EkigJZmG#source=blog\u0026medium=web\u0026campaign=06_2021_creator-profiles]). \n\n## Q3 preview: Improving the presentation workflow\n\nWe’re creating a space where anyone can discover, create, collaborate on, present, and publish their best thinking. \n\nWhen we announced our Series B funding, we highlighted several ambitious undertakings we’ll be focusing on to help bring our vision to life. But what makes Pitch special isn’t any one feature — it’s our ability to make the entire process around presentations fast, beautiful, and joyful. \n\nIn Q3, we’ll continue to balance our big bets with foundational features and quality-of-life improvements. If you’ve been using Pitch for a while, you’ll definitely appreciate updates like: \n\n**Fine-tuning the import and export experience:** We’re working to bring our PowerPoint importer out of beta by making sure it’s able to optimize your existing decks for Pitch. (That also means we’ll be able to look at how teams can export .pptx files out of Pitch.) And we’re making our PDF exports smaller, so you have no issues emailing files. \n\n**Improving core parts of the editing experience:** Our product team is working to overhaul our text editor to support future features and allow us to make real-time co-editing even more powerful. And much-requested features like grouping are also in development. \n\n**More integrations, embeds, and stickers:** We’re getting close to introducing our third integration, which will help subscription businesses keep tabs on their revenue data. Plus we’ll be introducing additional embeds, and adding more stickers to reflect a broader range of visual styles. \n\nThere’s a lot more on the way!

Your product. This pitch deck mirrors the design elements of the imaginary product featured — a scooter.

It contrasts personal, organic elements like black-and-white photos and mismatched fonts with more formal elements like the grid lines of a notebook, a traditional “up and to the right” line graph, and the window of a web browser.\n\nCreate a similar scrapbook vibe with this [1984 template](https://pitch.com/templates/1984-0Bpewb4BhG7a4yuMa43dPwyC), featuring web browser windows and typewriter fonts.\n\n## [Hyperbeast](https://pitch.com/public/8fa65028-85d5-490b-bc39-2dd899d6869e/cca2aa93-e7ff-45ee-aa4e-40dcb5886725), by [Emir Kenar](https://dribbble.com/emirkenar)\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/8fa65028-85d5-490b-bc39-2dd899d6869e\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe colors in this deck were seared into our retinas, in the best possible way. The rave-inspired imagery and tie-dye effects blend seamlessly with best practices like consistent headers and footers. The scannable barcode at the bottom-right fits with the overall theme — and could also be used for practical purposes, such as to link to the brand’s website or social pages.\n\nFor your next presentation, take it back to the ’90s with [this retro template](https://pitch.com/templates/Made-in-the-90s-7Ct6EB2HWKFo5d3KFv61Xayn) from designer [Emiland de Cubber](https://pitch.com/u/emiland).\n\n## 6 tips for creating presentation designs that impress\n\nThe winning Dribbble competition entries prove that great presentation design can draw on any visual style — but often follows consistent design principles. Whether you’re a professional designer, a startup founder, or a marketer at an established brand, you can add pop to your (and your teams’) presentations by considering the [presentation design elements](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips) below.\n\n### 1. Jump-start your deck with AI\n\nEver wondered how much time you’ve wasted staring at a blank slide? Pitch’s [AI presentation generator](https://pitch.com/) can help when the spark’s not sparking. It’s the fastest way to create new decks on any topic. Just enter a prompt, select a color palette and font, and voilà — blank slides are magically filled with relevant content. You can then edit and adapt your draft with your team until you’re happy with the result.\n\n### 2. Find on-brand fonts\n\nFonts can be as evocative as imagery, so think carefully about which ones you choose. Instead of going with defaults like Arial, test custom fonts — and notice how different spacings and weights subtly change the character of your slides. Once you’ve selected a font that fits, you can [add your custom font to your deck](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4057308-upload-custom-fonts) with Pitch so every slide is on-brand.\n\n### 3. Create consistency\n\n[Consistency is key to building a powerful brand](https://marcom.com/build-trust-brand-consistency/). Everyone notices that one slide with the misaligned page number, off-center image, or pixelated logo. Clutter can also undermine what you're trying to communicate.  Luckily it’s easy to demonstrate your attention to detail by using [professionally designed templates](https://pitch.com/templates). You could also [create a template](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5295469-intro-to-templates-and-styles) from a deck you'd like to keep reusing to ensure that future decks are consistent in their structure and style.\n\n### 4. Set signposting elements\n\nPeople intuitively look for visual hierarchy. Using the right signposting can guide your audience through your narrative. Headers, footers, color-coded sections, and section breaks make your slides easier to follow — and more memorable.\n\n### 5. Be selective with supporting visuals\n\nThe right picture is worth a thousand words. Choose visuals that simplify your narrative, reinforce your brand, and are easy to interpret. For instance, if you’re adding data visualization elements, just show the information that's truly necessary, and choose a style that fits your branding.\n\n### 6. Add contrast and movement\n\nDesigns are most powerful when they feel fun and dynamic. Eye-catching design is about contrasts, so test out various colors, fonts, and textures. If you need color inspiration for your brand, play around with [Adobe’s color tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), which also includes accessibility templates. Movement also makes your slides stand out. Try adding GIFs, animations, [videos](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5915008-create-video-recordings), and even [stickers](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4319772-add-and-edit-shapes-and-stickers) to keep your audience engaged.\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nPresentations offer you a chance to combine words, images, animations, colors, and fonts to tell your unique story — and achieve your business goals. We hope you’ve been inspired by the creativity of these nine very talented designers, who all crafted their decks in Pitch. \n\nFor more inspiration, head to the dedicated [Dribbble playoff collection](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/pitch-perfect-presentations-playoff-6fDfvv2Qc7fE4noK3N2UpXQ1) on our presentation gallery, or get started on your own deck by [signing up](https://app.pitch.com/?signup) for a free Pitch account.

From holding meetings in Zoom or cutting through the chatter on Slack, everyone is learning to navigate our \"new normal.\"\n\nPitch has been a remote-friendly organization since the start, and we’ve learned a thing or two along the way. One of our biggest takeaways is that keeping the entire company updated on a regular basis is a massive challenge. \n\nWhen you think of company-wide updates, all hands are probably the first thing that comes to mind. But as anyone who has tried to hold an all hands via video knows, it's not easy. With people scattered across different time zones, someone will inevitably be forced to join in after hours, and even if you do manage to find a time slot, who wants to add yet another meeting to our already busy days? \n\nWe realized pretty early on that we needed a better way to keep the organization updated. One that was asynchronous, agile, and suited to the way we work today. That's how we discovered weekly bulletins: a remote-friendly alternative to all hands.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/bulletin_slides_le3kdi.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si1.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Introducing bulletins: The new way to do all hands\n\nMeetings and emails aren’t always the ideal format for presenting information. You can only put so much into an email before it becomes too long, and the time-bound nature of meetings means you’re forced to edit or cut out information. They aren't really interactive because even if you do have time for a Q\u0026A at the end of an all-hands meeting, not everyone feels comfortable speaking up. And hitting reply-all to the entire company? That’s for the truly brave.\n\nPresentations allow people to express their ideas succinctly, with multimedia, and in a much less stressful environment than composing a memo or all-company email that many people will never read. They're also much more interactive than emails or meetings. People can engage, comment, and share their thoughts in their own time.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/collaboration-for-blog-hb_tfuqif.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/fallback_comments.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHere's how it works: Each Friday, we all collaborate on a presentation that is sent to the company. We call these our weekly bulletins, and they’re our way of keeping the entire team up to date about what’s going on at Pitch.\n\nWe use these weekly bulletins for high-level updates. They give us a chance to celebrate quick wins as well as larger initiatives, since we don't have to trim content for time. We link out to relevant pages in Notion or Figma for anyone who wants to delve into deeper explorations.\n\nImportant company news, like new hires and office updates, is located at the front of the deck. The rest is dedicated to updates from team members. People can add as many or as few slides as they like, and each team has their own section, so it’s easy to navigate and build.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/small-image-w800-1.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## In-the-moment updates and historical records\n\nThe asynchronous nature of bulletins means everyone has time to thoughtfully consume and comment on ongoing work across the company, which leads to greater collaboration between teams and departments. Plus, those who may not feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting can still share their thoughts.\n\nIn addition to providing weekly updates of what’s going on in the company, bulletins also serve as historical records of what we've been working on. This makes for great onboarding reading for newbies and it also provides perspective on how far a team has come and how the company has evolved.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/bi_bulletins.jpg] [alt:Pitch team bulletin] [caption:A look back at our weekly bulletins] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## A few more reasons why we love bulletins\n\n* **Always available:** Bulletins can be consumed and engaged with in someone’s own time, and offer the space to celebrate other’s work while effectively distributing information.\n* **Fully transparent:** With bulletins, it’s always clear what other teams are working on.\n* **Fun to create — and read:** We actually look forward to reading bulletins! Everyone loves to get creative, adding GIFs and fun pops of personality in their slides.\n\n## Less time in meetings, more time doing what matters\n\nWe wanted to make it quick and easy for everyone in the company to work on the bulletin, so we created a [template in Pitch](https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Bulletin-4LHZR30w7ycz4dfQZK0cJtae) that we use each week. It takes just a few minutes to drag and drop slides from the template into the presentation and customize the copy and image. The template has multiple slide layouts with image placeholders, so non-designers don't have to worry about cropping, resizing, or styling. \n\nThe work of creating each weekly bulletin is fully distributed. Everyone from interns to team leads and founders are contributing, so the work doesn't pile up onto any one person. Each person spends a little bit of time, and it really adds up! Think about if you have a company of 100 people, each week you spend:\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/bulletins_post_small4.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe great ideas come from everywhere. That’s why we try to do everything we can to enable everyone at Pitch to be part of the conversations we’re having as a company. As a remote-friendly company, it’s important to us that everyone has visibility into what others are working on, no matter where they’re working from. Bulletins have given us a way to elevate all-company updates into something that’s truly enjoyable and special to create and consume. \n\n**But don’t just take it from us, try [our template](https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Bulletin-4LHZR30w7ycz4dfQZK0cJtae) for yourself and let us know how you get on.**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/ac0e268f-890a-45eb-a3ef-045ba8ea26f7?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["News"],"title":"Announcing our limited preview beta \u0026 new funding","date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Christian Reber","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/pitch-lpr.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/pitch-lpr-meta.jpg","tweet-text":"See what the future of presentation software looks like. @Pitch is expanding its invite-only beta with the help of some additional funding.

Co-investors include Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger from Instagram and Rahul Vohra from Superhuman, among others. It’s super exciting to have them join our journey, as these companies, much like Slack and Zoom and so many more, are truly changing the way we communicate, collaborate, and get work done.\n\nIn recent weeks we’ve had the honor of inviting teams whose products we use and are inspired by, like Notion and Framer, to be among the first testers of Pitch. Over the coming months, we’ll be inviting more teams progressively to learn from their feedback so we can offer the best possible experience once we make it publicly available.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/pitch-lpr-animation_gzcxpg.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/ui-all-hands-on-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBuilding a truly delightful user experience has always been our top priority, so we put a lot of time into understanding the problems people have with presentation software. We teamed up with our good friends at MetaLab, one of the world's most renowned product design agencies, and through interviews, surveys, and focus groups, we learned why people love presentations, why people hate them, and what we could do to make the whole experience significantly better.\n\nPitch is a new kind of presentation software, with superpowers that you’ve always wanted in a modern tool. Smart formatting and [custom-crafted templates](https://pitch.com/templates) make designing beautiful slides feel like magic. Collaboration features help you stay up-to-date on progress, reuse and remix the best content from your team and stay on brand. Real-time communication means teams can work smoothly together — no matter where they are or what device they’re using, online and offline.\n\nFeedback like this makes us excited that we’re on the right track. More than just building a presentation software, we see Pitch as a huge opportunity to have a real impact on how people make decisions and distribute information.\n\nHundreds of millions of people rely on presentations to communicate their most important ideas, yet until now, they haven’t had great software to support them. Given the amount of critical decisions being made across business, politics, education, and creative communities through the medium of presentations, Pitch has the ambition to shape how people work and spark change.\n\nWe’re looking forward to moving into the next phase of our journey and starting to welcome more of you along for the ride.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"The art of online pitching: How to nail your next virtual presentation","visible-title":"The art of online pitching: How to nail your next virtual presentation","date":"2022-12-15T05:32:35.293Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Ariane Phipps-Morgan","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195179/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Header_MOBILE_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195180/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Header_SMALL_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195179/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Header_MID_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195179/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Header_BIG_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations_w1920.png","image-description":"Founder wearing a black hat with the word 'Pitch' on it, pointing to the right while pitching a virtual presentation on a purple background.","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195178/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations.png","thumbnail-description":"Founder wearing a black hat with the word 'Pitch' on it, pointing to the right while pitching a virtual presentation on a purple background.","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1671195180/blog/The%20art%20of%20online%20pitching/Social_share_How_to_pitch_online_and_nail_virtual_presentations.png","meta-image-description":"Founder wearing a black hat with the word 'Pitch' on it, pointing to the right while pitching a virtual presentation on a purple background.","tweet-text":"Looking to virtually pitch your business idea to investors?

With the shift to virtual meetings, founders can easily connect with potential investors and showcase their ideas. But with this convenience comes higher expectations. A technical glitch or poor audio quality can derail your presentation, turning your meetings into a missed opportunity. \n\nBy sharpening your online pitching skills — both in front of the camera and behind the scenes — you can make a strong impression and secure investment for your startup. In this article, we'll walk you through how to prepare, optimize, and [deliver your online pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/steps-to-delivering-a-standout-pitch) to convince your audience and take your startup to the next level.\n\n## Prepping for your pitch \n\nThe path to a successful online pitch is paved with preparation. In today’s hyperdigital world, simply presenting a stunning pitch deck on a video call is often not enough to convince potential investors. By taking the time to go through a couple of extra steps, you can make sure your virtual meeting pays off.\n\n### Get to know your potential investors\n\nYou’ll have a better chance at winning over investors if you’re able to speak to their specific needs and preferences, so it's important to take some time to get to know your audience. Research their backgrounds and interests, and find out what makes them tick. This will help you build relationships and establish strong connections — which we all know are especially valuable in the startup world.\n\n### Adjust and tailor your pitch \n\nNow that you’ve scoped out your audience, you can use the information you’ve gathered to perfect your pitch. To tell a consistent story that’s tailored to the interests of your investors, follow the 80/20 rule — using your core pitch deck as an anchor, make small personalization adjustments like adding a relevant GIF or slide from the appendix.\n\nA [successful pitch deck](https://pitch.com/blog/15-great-pitch-decks-from-successful-startups) is able to highlight the strengths of the startup and its potential for growth. Be clear and concise, and emphasize why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/funding-pitch-deck.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Investor-Pitch-Deck-52NJt62Vk3cZ5g7Hgb3XGSPG\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/VC-Pitch-Deck-33Lsdq7J5Cg84ni9Fd632kB8\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/VC_Pitch_Deck.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Try for free] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Practice, practice, practice \n\nOnce you’ve designed and [structured your pitch deck](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-deck-structure), outline what you want to cover during your presentation. Write out a script, and practice it until it becomes second nature. You don’t need to memorize your script word for word, but you should be able to smoothly recount all of the information. \n\nHere are a few practical tips that’ll ensure you can do that (and stay as cool as a cucumber) on your big day:\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1661246547/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-customize-speaker-view.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1661267787/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-customize-speaker-view-still.png] [caption:Pitch's speaker view where you can customize speaker notes, add a clock, and set a timer. ] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n* **Use a timer**. By accurately gauging the length of your presentation, you’ll make sure there’s enough time for ample discussion with investors afterward. \n* **[Optimize your speaker notes](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4056889-present-using-speaker-view)**. Jot down concise points to guide you as you deliver your pitch. Try not to read your notes verbatim or rely on them too heavily. \n* **Speak at a conversational pace**. Talking a mile a minute signals that you’re nervous — and makes it harder for people to understand you. If you feel yourself speeding up, pause to take a breath and then resume speaking. \n* **Rehearse in front of an audience**. Replicate a virtual environment by inviting friends or colleagues to watch your presentation on their laptops. This will familiarize you with the video call setting and help you feel more comfortable.\n* **Make a recording of your pitch**. How you frame yourself on camera can affect how your audience perceives your nonverbal communication. [​​Create a video recording of your presentation](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5915008-create-video-recordings) and check how your facial expressions, gestures, and overall energy come across on screen. \n\nConsider hiring a public speaking coach. If you tend to get nervous when speaking in front of others, a coach can help you prepare with tailored strategies on how to deal with the anxiety and deliver with confidence.\n\n## Optimizing your virtual setup \n\nVirtual pitching isn’t just delivering an in-person presentation in front of a camera — it’s a whole different way of communicating. But successful online pitches also take careful planning. \n\nIn fact, it may sound a little negative, but it’s important to plan for the worst. Approach your pitch with a [Murphy’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) mindset. Knowing that “anything that can go wrong will go wrong” will help you identify potential pitfalls and find solutions for them before the meeting even starts.\n\nAt the very least, familiarize yourself with your video calling platform’s features and settings — you don’t want to be searching for the screen sharing button when you’re about to present. And, as we’ve mentioned, invite your team to join a practice call. That way, you can see both what will appear on your screen as well as what investors will see as attendees. \n\nIf you want to look like a pro, though, your equipment is where it’s at.\n\n### Setting up your equipment\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1600106735/website-images/cc/images/camera%402x.jpg] [alt:a 3D image of a blue camera] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYour computer is probably already equipped with a webcam and a built-in microphone. But investing in good lighting, an additional microphone, and a quality camera can enhance the overall experience. \n\nThe golden rule of lighting for video calls is to have light sources in front of you. Ring lights and mini-panel lights are affordable options that are easy to transport. In terms of audio, opt for an external microphone so you can freely gesture during your presentation without disrupting the sound. And to really level up your online pitch, consider purchasing a quality webcam with at least 1080px resolution and 60fps frame rate.\n\nWith more elements in your control, you can come across just as well in a virtual pitch as you would during an in-person meeting.\n\n## Delivering your online pitch \n\nNow that you have the essentials in place, it’s time to create a checklist for the day of your video call. Before you enter the virtual meeting room, ask yourself the following questions:\n\n* Have you checked if your webcam and microphone are working? \n* Is your background clean and professional-looking? \n* Are your stats up to date, and do you have all the necessary files ready? \n* Is your internet connection stable? \n* Have you closed all unnecessary tabs to minimize distractions? \n* Are your devices on “do not disturb” mode? \n\nOnce you’ve ticked all these boxes, try to relax, breathe, and get your mind into pitching mode. Be sure you’re sitting comfortably at least 30 minutes before your call begins.\n\n### During the call\n\nAs your guests begin to arrive, welcome them and thank them for joining the call. Depending on the number of guests you have, you may want to include some level of moderation. For instance, you could give a short round of introductions and clarify when to ask questions before diving into your pitch. This will help facilitate clear communication among all the participants.\n\nLook directly into the camera. Simulating eye contact can help build a more personal connection. If you’re using the built-in webcam on your laptop, consider using a piece of brightly colored tape or a sign to draw your attention to the camera.\n\nTake your time when answering questions. It’s OK to say you need a minute. It’s better to pause and give a thoughtful answer than offer a rushed response that fails to accurately address the question at hand.\n\nAsk questions to dig deeper into the founder-investor fit. By posing pre-prepared questions to your audience, you can further personalize the pitch while also getting a better understanding of your potential investors and what their values are.\n\nDiscuss what the next steps will be. Clarify any expectations that investors might have, and determine a timeline for how to move forward. Getting everyone on the same page before ending the call lays a foundation for transparency and accountability.\n\nAnd it goes without saying, but make sure to thank the investors. They’re likely meeting with many founders, so expressing gratitude shows you acknowledge the value of their time.\n\n## Nail your virtual presentation and raise funding with Pitch\n\nVirtual fundraising has opened up a new world of investment opportunities. Whether it’s your first call with an angel investor or you’re in your Series B round of financing, video calls have most likely already impacted the way you raise money for your company.\n\nAdequate preparation involves not just thinking about what you want to say, but also being aware of the key factors that can affect the quality of your video call.\n\nTo create the best experience possible, embrace your inner videographer and learn about the various capabilities of your communication software. With plenty of practice and some careful planning, you’ll impress investors every time you deliver an online pitch.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655886801/fundraising-guide/startup-pitch-deck.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/10-Slide-Pitch-Deck-0dh4WE6siodH4gWAjk0og4tB\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/10_Slide_Pitch_Deck.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more pitch deck templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Voices"],"title":"Azeem Azhar’s tips for founders in the Exponential Age","date":"2021-09-16T06:14:42.357Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Will Gluckin","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631773055/blog/Header_MOBILE_AzeemAzhar_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631773054/blog/Header_SMALL_AzeemAzhar_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631773055/blog/Header_MID_AzeemAzhar_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631788091/blog/Header_BIG_AzeemAzhar_w1920.jpg","image-description":"Azeem Azhar is the founder of Exponential View","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631773043/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_AzeemAzhar.jpg","thumbnail-description":"Azeem Azhar is the founder of Exponential View","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1631773057/blog/Social_share_AzeemAzhar.jpg","meta-image-description":"Azeem Azhar is the founder of Exponential View","teaser-text":"Exponential View's Azeem Azhar recently joined us for Pitch Live to discuss the implications of a dawning era for startup founders.","excerpt":"Does the world seem to be moving faster these days?

According to Azeem Azhar, that’s because tech is advancing faster than our ability to adapt to it. Azhar recently joined us in an edition of our event series, Pitch Live, to discuss the implications of this widening gap for startup founders. Dig into our key takeaways, and take a look at Azeem’s full presentation in Pitch.\n\nAzeem Azhar is an author, investor, and the founder of [Exponential View](https://www.exponentialview.co/), a newsletter and podcast dedicated to understanding our future. [His new book](http://hyperurl.co/exptwtw), which we highly recommend to founders, is called “the Exponential Age\" in the US and Canada and \"Exponential\" elsewhere. In it, Azhar explains that we’re living in an era in which the rate of technological progress is dramatically increasing, and our society and institutions can’t keep up. This “Exponential Gap” can create chaos and disruption, he notes, but the same forces can pave the way for positive change. \n\nIn a recent edition of Pitch Live, Azhar previewed insights from his new book, revealed the traits of successful, sustainable businesses that will stay ahead of technology’s disruptive curve, and highlighted founders’ role in helping society keep pace with progress.\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/35PG5d9veak\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Founders provide a bridge to the future\n\nUsing the early days of Facebook as a comparison, Azhar noted that newer social media competitors like Bytedance (the company behind TikTok) get to build their products on fast-moving new technologies, which means they can grow at a rate that makes their predecessors’ success look unimpressive by contrast. The proof is in the numbers: Startups are now hitting $1B+ valuations in just a couple of years, which not long ago would have been unthinkable. \n\nSo the savviest entrepreneurs recognize tech with the potential to go exponential — which, first and foremost, is about having vision. \n\n“The key task of a founder,” advises Azhar, “is to be a bridge between a technology that isn’t quite ready, and a market that isn’t ready for any number of reasons.”  A great founder can connect an emerging technology with a future audience that will use and even depend on it. So as you turn your inspiring idea into a plan to build your business, remember to [choose your tech foundations](https://pitch.com/blog/every-week) carefully, and with scale in mind.\n\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\"The key task of a founder is to be a bridge between a technology that isn’t quite ready, and a market that isn’t ready.\"] [footer:] [layout:big]  [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Timing is everything — not being first to market\n\nAccording to Azhar, the best moment to adopt new tech is generally when it’s still a bit expensive, knowing that in a few years that technology will be both better and cheaper. But don’t wait too long: Countless startups have gone bust waiting for the sweet spot between novelty and practicality. The trick is to pick the right moment on the “cost curve”.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all-solution to this problem, so as a founder, you should make practical decisions based on what you can afford to invest in, and the team you can build to work with it.  You may not get to be first, but sometimes, it pays to wait for your moment.\n\n“The thing to bear in mind,” Azhar said in a follow-up conversation, “is that declining prices lead to ubiquity, and ubiquity creates complementary products and services. It may be that, as a founder, your place will be to provide one of the complements rather than the tech itself.” This can still be a great, and greatly lucrative, place to be. \n\n## Tech isn’t neutral, nor are those who build it\n\nWhen prominent entrepreneurs find themselves in hot water (or, say, called to testify in front of Congress) they often jump to a familiar defense: They just provide the platforms, and it’s up to the rest of us to decide how to use them. \n\nBut tech is not, in fact, neutral: The political, economic, and social values of people who build things will inevitably shape what they choose to build and how. This affects everything from company culture, to how products are used, to the impact those products have on the world. And when things get ugly, they get ugly on a bigger scale than ever before — sending leaders scrambling to do damage control. \n\nAzhar suggests that founders must recognize and account for the inherent bias of their products. That means articulating your own values and building them into your mission from day one. “If the starting point is to disrupt rather than improve... I think it is hard to frame a sense of responsibility,” he says. Not doing so can signal that you lack foresight at best, and at worst, that you truly don’t care. \n\n## Founders can help shrink the Exponential Gap\n\nDriven by profit, companies often fail to check themselves, until forced to do so by what Azhar calls “the regulatory value of the norms and customs and habits” of our society and its institutions. But the Exponential Gap is widening: Technological progress, and the companies that run on it, are outpacing our society’s ability to push back. \n\nIn this pivotal moment, the tech industry has a big role to play in building a healthy economy and a sustainable society. Founders can carefully choose who they want to do business with, internally and externally. Investors can make values-driven choices about where to put their money. And successful entrepreneurs can use their huge social and political capital to educate the world on where we’re all headed — and how we can be ready. \n\nAnd of course, it all comes back around to the business. Founders choose the impact they want to make when they choose what to build in the first place. As tech increasingly leads us on a journey into the future, we can chart our course with those choices. \n\n*Check out Azeem Azhar’s full presentation below, and [join our community](https://pitch.com/community) to stay up to speed on our next events.*\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/3a05f319-8bb6-4889-ac7f-620263c2d73d\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"Building product-led sales teams","date":"2022-09-13T10:14:10.741Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Nicholas Mills","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730295/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Header_MOBILE_Building_product-led_sales_teams_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730295/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Header_SMALL_Building_product-led_sales_teams_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730294/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Header_MID_Building_product-led_sales_teams_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730295/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Header_BIG_Building_product-led_sales_teams_w1920_-1.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730294/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Building_product-led_sales_teams.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730296/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Social_share_Building_product-led_sales_teams.png","teaser-text":"Learn how sales can accelerate product-led growth, by helping your early adopters expand usage within their teams.","excerpt":"A product-led growth (PLG) approach can make it easier to attract new users, but turning those signups into meaningful, recurring revenue can be tricky.

As a sales leader, your challenge is to create a sales motion that works with a product-led funnel and culture. Here’s how I’ve seen it work best, from my time at CircleCI, Stripe, and now Pitch. \n\nPLG has transformed the way teams bring software products to market. Scoring a first touchpoint with your ideal customer has never been easier — in fact, when done right, it happens automatically. But then comes the hard part: Even your product's most enthusiastic champions need to run an internal gauntlet of procurement, pricing, onboarding, training, and more. This is where a sales team can make all the difference. As much as [25% of conversions](https://gainsight2.drift.click/product-led-growth-index) from free to paid users can be led by sales in a PLG company, versus 18% from the product. \n\nTo create a sales team that delivers value in a PLG-driven motion, you need to know: \n\n* When — and who — to hire\n* How to work in sync with demand generation and product teams\n* How to create enablement materials that will make your team more efficient\n\n## Know when to hire your team \n\nPLG remains your company’s bread and butter, so you should only scale hiring once you can prove the value of your new sales roles. To understand what you’re aiming for, build a clear sales model that demonstrates how the inputs of your new function, like team size, will impact outcomes, like projected Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). \n\nYour model will be based on the number of leads your team receives from your bottom-up PLG motion. Sales funnel driver metrics should include the number of product-qualified leads, the number and size of deals, and conversion rates per funnel stage. Next, capture outcome metrics like the realistic amount of pipeline your team can create from these leads, win rate, average deal size, and the resulting sales-led ARR.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662452732/blog/product-demos-pls/sales-demo-template_cover.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Demo-6gXTPr2hMAM34ojxLE5vPKDg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:See more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPlug in industry benchmarks for these metrics to start with, and then refine with real data as you go. With this model, you can justify hiring your first team members — and have goals in place for when they start.\n\n## Look for people with sales discovery skills\n\nIt may sound obvious, but when building a product-led sales team, hire product-savvy sales reps. Now more than ever, your sales calls double as user and product research interviews. Knowing how to dig into the problems your product doesn’t yet solve and glean useful information — without compromising your sales narrative and risking the deal — is key. Even better? If a sales rep can turn a discovery call into a positive experience that makes closing the deal more likely. \n\nA talented salesperson can also use calls with large companies to identify new personas for marketing teams to target. These personas might include important stakeholders who aren’t part of the user group, but who still have influence over the purchasing decision. A great sales rep can generate a fresh stream of pain points and feature requests through these additional personas. Your team will also hear about new billing demands — for instance, maybe a large company would rather receive an internationally compliant invoice and pay by wire transfer than with a credit card. \n\n## Triage your product-qualified leads\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662730296/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/Inline_image_Building_product-led_sales_teams_w1200.png] [alt:A diagram of a dual funnel growth model that combines product-led growth and sales-led engagement that accelerates adoption and paid usage for the highest potential Workspaces. The product-led growth model begins with marketing at the awareness level, with product-led user activation, engagement, value, growth, and monetization and retention. High-potential companies go into a sales-led funnel, where sales comes in between activation and engagement. Together with community support, sales teams help increase engagement, value, growth, and monetization.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nQualification is an ongoing process of discovery, and this is never more true than in product-led sales. But your sales team can’t (and shouldn’t) speak to every user. The good news? You already have the data you need to triage the leads they should be connecting with. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Begin with product usage data. Create triggers when a user engages with a premium feature, invites more collaborators, or starts using the product more frequently. But hold off on sending all those leads straight to sales. \n2. Next, layer in firmographic data so you have a fuller picture of your users’ potential value. Ask them to self-segment based on their role, and add third-party enrichment data from the likes of [Crunchbase](https://about.crunchbase.com/products/data-enrichment/) or [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/platform/enrichment). \n3. Then send these high potential, engaged users — your product-qualified leads — to sales for further nurturing. \n4. Direct engaged leads from smaller companies to self-serve flows in the product.\n\nThe best sales processes I’ve implemented have been data-driven, signal-based systems that helped us target and qualify the right leads with the right messaging at the right point in their journey. \n\n## Give your team the tools to get to “yes”\n\nYou might have a new team of people ready to nurture high-value leads, but it’ll be an uphill battle if you don’t enable them correctly. This isn’t just about product marketing arming them with messaging and collateral — it’s also about the format that collateral takes. Reps will have to [deliver demos](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-ace-your-product-led-sales-demo) to groups with varying levels of product familiarity. When early users who are very familiar with your product bring in their CEO, you’ll need to cater to this mixed audience through modular decks and collateral. \n\nFirst, create a flexible [sales deck template](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales). This way, your reps can stay consistent in terms of branding, messaging, and design but can easily customize presentations by including the sections that apply and skipping those that don’t. Then consider which other [sales enablement tools](https://pitch.com/blog/top-tools-to-automate-remote-b2b-sales) will contribute to your productivity — especially those designed with product-led sales teams in mind, such as [Pocus](https://pitch.com/presentations/Pocus-Sales-Deck-5HZp2j23CLBT5Cehtz5rjoyQ), [Patch](https://pitch.com/presentations/Patch-Sales-Deck-7BksPv2c7rFe57Rfdh6pZjru), and [Spendesk](https://pitch.com/presentations/Spendesks-Sales-Deck-53hUnE6fFxf75J4vaG23ugJ5).\n\n## A model that’s greater than the sum of its parts\n\nBuilding a product-led sales team is one of the most rewarding challenges I’ve encountered as a sales leader. You face the traditional problem of creating, empowering, and nurturing a sales organization. Yet you also need to be more data-driven, experimental, customer-centric, and product-minded than usual. \n\nWhen this all comes together, it results in a model that’s greater than the sum of its parts. PLG creates a funnel full of sales opportunities. And by winning more “top logos,” sales can yield persuasive testimonials and social proof that attract even more PLG signups.\n\nSales teams aren’t just an extension of PLG startups — they have a crucial role to play in building a revenue stream that complements and accelerates product-led momentum.\n\n## Get started\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662452713/blog/product-demos-pls/Sales_Deck-with-video-recordings.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Proposal-7TzhtL6zL3VC4R4itc4cUVNB\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1663058138/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams/sales-proposal_1.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:See more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"15 climate tech startups and their winning pitch decks","visible-title":"15 climate tech startups and their winning pitch decks","date":"2022-10-13T06:35:43.963Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Athena Lam","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665643569/blog/15%20climate%20tech%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Climate-tech-startups-Header_MOBILE.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665643571/blog/15%20climate%20tech%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Climate-tech-startups-Header_SMALL.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665643570/blog/15%20climate%20tech%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Climate-tech-startups-Header_MID.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665643571/blog/15%20climate%20tech%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Climate-tech-startups-Header_BIG.png","image-description":"A collection of cover slides of 15 climate tech startups and their winning pitch decks behind a globe","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665643568/blog/15%20climate%20tech%20startup%20pitch%20decks/Climate-tech-startups-Cover_thumbnail.png","thumbnail-description":"A collection of cover slides of 15 climate tech startups and their winning pitch decks behind a globe","meta-image-description":"A collection of cover slides of 15 climate tech startups and their winning pitch decks behind a globe","tweet-text":"See how these climate tech startups have crafted impact-focused pitch decks to raise pre-seed to Series C funding since 2020.

That sounds great in theory, right? Working in the design space for 15+ years now, I can tell you quite confidently that it’s easier said than done. During the day-to-day, all too often the work that needs to get done takes priority.\n\nWhen I joined Pitch in 2018, the appreciation for open design stood out to me as something I wanted to help weave into our culture. From the beginning, we made it a priority to open the product design process to the rest of the company as much as possible. That meant not just making it easy for people to give feedback, but really building processes that encouraged a deeper understanding of how and why we design in a certain way.\n\nPitch is a company with a lot of people who have a product mindset and an eye for good work. This leads to people across the entire team being very interested (and opinionated) about product and design. Being part of such a collaborative company is great, but it comes with its own set of challenges. In this post, I share what I've learned about dealing with some of them, like:\n\n* How do you deal with the noise of conflicting opinions?\n* How can you avoid endless feedback rounds and structure for progress?\n* How do you keep people happy when they feel their feedback is being ignored?\n\nI'll also share some of the internal processes and tools we use to develop trust and transparency inside the organization.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/bubble-bath.jpg] [alt:Feedback can be noisy] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### How do you deal with the noise of conflicting opinions?\n\nWhen you invite everyone to share their opinion, you should be prepared for a lot of noise. And that’s okay: Noise isn’t bad. In fact, more noise means more perspectives and a wider diversity of ideas.  When it comes to dealing with noise, you don’t need to turn down the volume, just make sure it’s tuned to the right station.\n\n### Never just “ask for feedback”\n\nGeneral feedback often isn’t very helpful and leads to long, broad discussions. Unless that’s what you’re going for, make sure to be specific and mindful about the kind of feedback you want: Do you need visual design feedback? Is it more about the interactions? Are you unsure about the UX copy? The more specific you can get, the higher the chance of receiving relevant and helpful feedback.\n\n### Screen incoming feedback up front\n\nAgain, it's all about the ask. You can reduce the amount of irrelevant feedback you receive by providing the right context (and the right amount of it). Don't try to cram a lengthy explanation into a single Slack message. The more you write and the more you try to explain, the higher the likelihood that people will misunderstand or miss information. In case you do need space for more details, you can always link out or attach additional information, like a well-structured document that explains your thinking and considerations.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/notion-feature.jpg] [alt:] [caption:Pitch notion feature page] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhenever we work on a feature, we frame the problem, background, and goals as clearly as possible using a simple, flexible Notion template. Using a template is more efficient and the standard format ensures we're all on the same page. Plus, it offers the perfect amount of context if you need to share with others for deeper feedback.\n\n## How do you move past feedback and get the OK to move ahead?\n\nOften, meetings and feedback and revisions are ongoing. The tips for screening noise work very well on a case-by-case basis. But when you're working on a larger project that involves many people in the company, you often face much more noise coming from many different angles for a much longer period of time. For these situations, it's helpful to create regular, recurring touch points that are designed to push the project forward and away from circling debates.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nWhen you’re working on something that’s sure to have a lot of noise, structure your workflow for progress.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFor example, during a recent redesign project, we introduced a weekly team meeting. The meeting's main objective was to get sign-offs from key stakeholders on different product teams. We wanted to make sure we could get the okay to move ahead, not get bogged down in suggestions. The meeting consisted of two parts:\n\n* **Sign-off:** We presented design work that had already gone through a few iterations, giving us enough confidence to ask key stakeholders for final approval\n* **Work-in-progress:** We shared specific features we were working on to get feedback focused on the most critical areas we needed to move forward\n\nWe also made sure to [create a presentation](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips) that could be viewed and understood by those who weren't able to attend the meeting so that they would be able to share feedback as well.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/fab-deck-slider_snogjz.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/fab-deck-slider-placeholder.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis presentation put all of the earlier recommendations for how to ask for feedback into practice:\n\n* **Context**: What are we looking at, who is this for and why, explained through short text and accompanied by a click-prototype and video walkthrough\n* **Asking the relevant questions:** We made sure to include questions, not only to focus feedback on the relevant questions but also to provide prompts that encourage responses\n\n## How do you keep people happy if they feel their feedback is being ignored?\n\nYou'll inevitably come across times when people feel unheard or ignored for various reasons. Usually, it's a case of the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe they provided feedback that wasn’t relevant at that stage of the project, or maybe their feedback was overlooked by mistake. If people take time to give thoughtful feedback over and over again, but never see any response, they can easily become frustrated or disengaged. You can't act on every piece of feedback, but you can respond.\n\n### Understand the difference between reacting and responding\n\nEach and every piece of feedback doesn't need to be acted upon, but it should be heard, and, if not relevant or applicable, be responded to. What's the best thing to say when you don't agree? Offer a proposed alternative that directs them toward a less prescriptive approach by pushing them to identify the \"why,\" not the \"how.\"\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"I like that direction. Could you explain how you got to it?\"] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Communicate why some feedback isn't acted upon\n\nMake sure your team understands the cost of reacting to every piece of feedback (design by committee, wasteful iterations, running in circles, etc.) Then, explain what makes feedback valuable, so they can better present their opinions in a format that is specific, actionable, and objective.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"I want to understand your point of view. Could you please provide more detail?\"] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Recognize your responsibility in the situation\n\nYou have a lot more control than you think in ensuring people feel their feedback is heard. The context you provide and the questions you ask will determine the quality of feedback you get in return. Beyond being specific in your questions, explain what principles you'll use to prioritize incoming feedback.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"There are a number of directions we can try that achieve those goals. Let's prioritize based on the roadmap.\"] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Developing trust and transparency inside the organization\n\nWe believe that the design process — which is all about bringing intent to decisions — is something which the entire company practices. And we believe that the best way to do that is to keep the process as open as possible while getting people involved and educating why we would make one decision over another from a design perspective.\n\nOne example of what this looks like is our open Design Review. These meetings happen every Monday and are attended by the entire product design team, but they’re also open to anyone else who wants to provide feedback, ask questions, or just listen in. Sometimes engineers join and present ideas and prototypes to the design team, which, again, goes back to the point that design is not just a design team thing.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/design-review-2x.jpg] [alt:Photo of the design team at Pitch in their weekly design review meeting] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBut more than anything else, how we work is defined by the tools we work with. Here are some of the tools we use and how they help us make design more accessible to the rest of the company:\n\n### Slack: Democratic by design\n\nWe use Slack as our central communication channel. One unexpected way it helps us connect with the company on design is in the #product channel. This is a dedicated channel where anybody can post product feedback and ideas. There are some light rules in place, like stating what kind of feedback you are giving up front and staying as concise as possible, but beyond that, it’s entirely open for anyone to post.\n\nSince everybody in the company is able to see and react to posts in this channel, it tends to get a lot of activity and we can see very quickly what topics generate the most attention from the team. For example, if we see a certain feature request gets tons of reactions and responses, it raises a flag that there's a large level of excitement or consensus over this feature's value.\n\nVoting in Slack is another tool that's particularly effective when you need to make a decision on something that's primarily visual and needs very little additional explanation. Here's an example with a clear winner in a vote for variations of an empty state illustration.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si_designingintheopen.jpg] [alt:How Pitch uses Slack to get design feedback] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPolls are another interesting tool in Slack that we occasionally use. As an individual or small group it's useful when you want to make sure that you're not too biased in our thinking about a certain problem, or just need some general rough tendency indicators.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/poll.jpg] [alt:Using polls in Slack for design feedback] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Loom: Show, don’t tell\n\nIf designers need feedback on concepts, they not only share links to prototypes, but also record short videos. Taking a quick screen recording helps designers better illustrate flows while giving more context and explanation to a design. At Pitch, we use Loom for this, because you can easily record your screen and share the entire video via a simple link.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si4_designingintheopen.jpg] [alt:Using Loom to ask for design feedback] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Notion: Single source of truth\n\nOne of the things that’s really important to use is to ensure information is open and accessible. Whenever it comes to storing information in a more permanent way, our tool of choice is Notion. We use it to organize our roadmap, document and track feature progress, describe design iterations, keep meeting notes, and much more.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt’s not necessary to add a lot of meetings and complex processes to make design more open and accessible to the rest of the company. Making sure you're frequently sharing designs and providing regular updates to the entire team is already a solid start. Really, it's all having a mindset that's constantly thinking of ways to get the broader company involved and engaged. If you're open to receiving feedback from all directions and focused on building a shared understanding of design across the company, you’re well on your way to creating a more collaborative design process.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch","Voices"],"title":"Communicating \u0026 collaborating through change","date":"2020-05-07T08:51:00.000Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Oskar Zabik","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/remote_header_mobile.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/remote_header_small.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/remote_header_mid.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/oskar_header_big.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/remote_cover.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/social_collaboratingthroughchange.jpg","tweet-text":"This software engineer worked remotely his entire career.

We've had to adapt by finding new ways to work together, even when we’re not physically with our teams. For team leads or project managers who suddenly find themselves needing to coordinate and communicate between distributed coworkers for the first time, it’s an added challenge.\n\nAs someone who has worked remotely my entire career, I’ve experienced pretty much all the different situations you can imagine. I’ve been the only remote worker in a company, as well as the first remote employee to join (in fact, that was at Pitch!). Over the years, I’ve seen firsthand the collaboration and communication challenges remote workers face, both from the point of view of a manager and also as an employee. In this article, I’ll share some of the advice I’ve found the most valuable.\n\n## Dealing with information overflow\n\nMany of the tips in this post focus on Slack, because Slack is where much of our work today happens. While we use many other tools to collaborate — like Github, Notion, and of course, our own product — Slack is still the main place we communicate within our team and with the company.\n\nAs many people are quickly learning, when you work remotely, Slack is your main lifeline to your team. That often leads to a lot of information coming in from everywhere, at all times. On one hand, you don’t want to miss out on anything important, but on the other, it can be hard to separate what you should pay attention to and what’s just Slack chatter.\n\nOften people will say, “Just silence Slack.” But the thing is, when you’re remote, people can’t come up and tap you on the back, so you need to be available, especially as a manager.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/oskar_tee_post.jpg] [alt:Too many Slack messages] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### To DM or not to DM\n\nIt’s a best practice for distributed teams (and really, all teams) to keep conversations in public channels. This ensures everyone has visibility on discussions and decisions. In an ideal world, we would have most of our conversations in public channels, but switching to private messages is a bad habit that’s all too easy to fall into.\n\nWe consider ourselves an open company and value transparent communication, but looking into our Slack analytics, it’s clear that even we fall into the DM trap much more than we hope:\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si0_collaboratingthroughchange.jpg] [alt:How many messages in Slack are DMs] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSending messages privately isn’t just an issue on a company level, it’s also a hassle when it comes to personal communication. A major downside of using private messages is that you end up needing to repeat the same thing multiple times to different people on your team. Often, a topic comes up that you’ve already talked about with someone else, but because it was in a private message you can’t easily link them directly to the discussion. At the same time, you don’t suddenly want to talk about everything in the #engineering or #marketing channel, because it’s going to get lost in space among all the bots, reminders, requests, and other topics littering broad channels.\n\n## How to filter out noise and focus on what’s important\n\nOne solution I found that can be a helpful tool for any team using Slack: creating dedicated channels for specific discussions. This helps divide your conversations into more focused channels with a smaller group of participants. It also very clearly marks the places in Slack that need your attention first. These channels should become the sole place that require your immediate attention when you log on.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si_collaboratingthroughchange.jpg] [alt:create dedicated Slack channels for specific tops] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Each channel should have a specific goal. These are temporary places to have group discussions around a single topic. Once they’re no longer relevant, archive them.\n2. Stick to only having a few channels open at any given time — remember, this is about focus. Doing this will make context switching easier and provide a more accurate view of what the team is working on.\n3. To make it easier to find, these channels can be designated with a prefix. We use ws- (short for our team name, Team Workspaces)\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si_collaboratingthroughchange-1.jpg] [alt:Group Slack channels by topic] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe best part about this strategy is that it’s super flexible and can adapt to meet your needs, team, and projects. Recently, our marketing team started using it to centralize conversations around in-progress blog posts (using the prefix blog_postname). If you want to try it out, [I detailed how to set it up on my personal blog.](http://bowlofcode.com/better-slack-discussions-with-focused-short-living-channels/)\n\n## Building async communication habits in your team\n\nMost of my career I’ve worked in different time zones than the rest of my team so all of our communication was asynchronous. I had to learn very quickly how to adapt and learn to communicate in a way that would be effective. For those who suddenly find themselves working from home, here are a few tips for adjusting to async communication.\n\n### Don’t expect an immediate response\n\nYou must get away from the assumption that people will respond immediately - or even any time soon. It’s easier said than done, as we’ve become programmed to expect quick responses, both at work and in our personal life. But creating the expectation of immediate responses within a distributed team can do more harm than good. They might be in-the-zone, and stopping their work to answer your question shouldn’t be their priority. Slack pings can be very expensive, and everyone on the team should be aware of that.\n\n### Take advantage of Slack statuses\n\nSlack statuses are a small but mighty tool for communicating your availability to your team. Slack comes with a set of built-in statuses, but you can have quite a bit of fun deciding with your team what different emojis should represent. For example, using 🎧 to mimic wearing headphones in an open office (the universal signal for “I’m busy”). You can even [integrate with your Google calendar](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar), and your status will automatically update whenever you’re in a meeting.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si_collaboratingthroughchange-3.jpg] [alt:Ideas for Slack statuses] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Make sure information can be found, even if someone’s offline\n\nSlack is great, but it has its pitfalls. Always assume things can get lost there. Find a proper place for your documentation and use your calendar app often. We keep our technical documentation on Github, and everything else in Notion or Pitch, and we use the calendar to track important events like release dates and designate focus time. \n\nWe use Slack as a gateway to reaching these resources. Our channel description always contains links to the most important documentation, so people can easily access the information they need.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/si_collaboratingthroughchange-2.jpg] [alt:Link to important info from your Slack description ] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe also use Pitch to ensure information gets out of our team and to the rest of the company. Each Friday, we contribute to the company-wide[ weekly bulletin](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins), our remote-friendly solution to all-hands meetings. \n\n### A word on pings, bots, and @channel\n\nConsider the cost of @here or @channel pings and how many people you're distracting every time you use them. If you have 50 people in a channel, and each spends 2-3 minutes checking the channel, that’s 150 minutes that people are jolted out of their current work. This doesn’t even take into account the time it takes them to get back into whatever they were doing. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n@here and @channel should not be the way you signal that something is important.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOn our team, we use those pings only when something urgent requires immediate attention. Instead of using pings, we create dedicated channels for important topics. These follow some standard ground rules: Everyone is required to read what’s posted there, and they should not be used for chit chat or cat GIFs (unless, of course, this is important for your team, although in that case, I’d recommend a dedicated #cats channel).\n\nAnd one more tip: Stop ignoring the Slack prompts to unsubscribe from channels you’re not active in. At least once a month, take some time to clean up your Slack channels, remove pings from any bots that are not absolutely required, and see which channels you can unsubscribe from or mute.\n\n### The FOMO is real\n\nBeing remote means you’ll miss out on things, no matter how hard you try. Once, on a visit to the company headquarters in Berlin, I showed up to the office only to find everything was empty. It turned out that we had moved buildings and I had no idea! There’s no doubt that the move had been communicated and even overcommunicated, but it shows just how easy it is to miss critical details when there’s so much information coming in. This is an extreme example, but it shows that sometimes even big news can slip through the cracks.\n\nIt’s especially important to remember this when dealing with your team. You may have felt you said something 500 times, but that doesn’t mean they have heard it. If you want to be sure information has gotten through, ask!\n\n## Holding effective meetings (why, how, and when)\n\nNo one wants to add more meetings to their schedule. But, done correctly, meetings can be a powerful tool for keeping remote teams in sync and on schedule. We try to minimize the amount of meetings we have but maximize what we get out of them.\n\n### Make meetings standardized: Stick to a set format and time\n\nThis helps provide predictability so people can organize their weekly workload accordingly. It also helps to have a rule that all meetings should happen within a certain part of the day (for us, it’s 2 and 5). This is respectful to those who may be in different time zones and ensures they don’t feel pressure to join in after hours. Our regular occurring team meetings:\n\n1. **Weekly planning meetings:** We use this time to give quick updates on team status (Is anyone planning to go on vacation? What’s in the backlog?) Leaving the meeting, the team should be aligned on both prioritization and scope of their work that week.\n\n2. **Daily standups:** Some teams do standups in Slack, but we choose to do them on Zoom because nothing beats face-to-face time, especially on a remote team. The purpose of stand-ups is to keep everyone up to date, but what’s most important is to make them a sustainable habit. Again, predictability provides structure that remote workers may lack without daily office routines, commutes, etc.\n\n3. **Weekly cooler chat:** We dedicate a full hour every week to chat about non-work related things, like our hobbies, personal lives, and side projects. In today’s hyperproductive work culture, it may seem like a lot to spend a whole hour on this, but this hour is what makes us into a team when we haven’t seen each other in real life for awhile. I really enjoy the people I work with, and this is the time to embrace that.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nWhen managing a remote team, you need a lot of patience. Remember that there are people behind the avatars you see in online tools. Aim for async forms of communication, but value face-to-face time. This is especially important when delivering feedback or whenever you feel tension in written text (it usually goes away after a short call). Be empathetic and interested in your co-workers’ lives. Building products is as much about being able to interact with other people as it is about marketing or engineering, if not more!\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"Pitching is changing.

For most users, these presentations are their bread and butter — they help land clients, close deals, and grow accounts. But we’ve noticed a shift: Impressive slides alone aren’t enough anymore.\n\nGrowing revenue now means pitching repeatedly across multiple stages, with slides that adapt while staying on brand and on message. And it doesn’t stop there. Pitching has become more complex, requiring a personalized, interactive, and data-driven approach. To seal the deal, you need to deliver a seamless, end-to-end experience.\n\nAs the needs of pitching teams are evolving, so too is Pitch. Starting today, Pitch is more than just presentation software — it’s a complete pitching platform. For the first time ever, teams can create stunning decks and drive client interactions within a single, unified workflow.\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/st54wWXhTWo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGoodbye siloed processes, hello streamlined efficiency. There’s never been a better time to get everyone on board, from designers and marketers to customer-facing folks, so the whole team can collaborate under one roof. \n\nTo mark this chapter, we’re unveiling the new features that’ll help you craft polished slides and use them to generate transformative results.\n\n## Introducing the virtual pitch room\n\nPicture your pitching materials. You probably have a few decks — think proposal, company overview, feature updates. Then there are other documents like order forms and terms. Throw in meeting recordings, scheduling links, and videos, and it’s easy to lose track of what’s going on.\n\nThat’s why, with this launch, we’re excited to introduce the brand-new pitch room: a customizable, virtual space where you can provide clients a series of curated assets to streamline their decision-making.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945572/blog/pitching-platform/blog-pitch-rooms.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBy creating a room in Pitch, your team can now assemble multiple presentations, links, and files for a variety of different purposes. Spin up a digital sales room with pricing proposals and scheduling links to nurture a prospect. Create an onboarding room to welcome new leads with helpful videos and slides. Or deliver creative assets to customers at the close of a project, all in one place.\n\nYour clients are greeted with a sleek, personalized UI that includes a custom note and point of contact. But the room’s benefits go both ways. It also provides a clear overview for your team: You see exactly what’s being shared, and can prevent things from falling through the cracks.\n\n## Autofill a pitch room from your CRM\n\nIf you’re a customer-facing team, chances are you spend a lot of time in your CRM. To make life easier, we’ve created a handy plugin that lets you build a pitch room without ever leaving your workflow.\n\nWith the Pitch app for HubSpot, coming in December 2024, you can prefill a room with content or send decks to clients. Once you’re all set, you can then share the room’s link and password directly from the CRM, or jump into Pitch to edit your assets. \n\nThis plugin is just the first step of our plan to fully integrate the CRM, so teams juggling multiple projects and accounts can quickly share relevant content with new prospects. We’re already working on a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) integration, and would love [your input](https://tally.so/r/nrrBQL) on which CRM should be next.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1731945585/blog/pitching-platform/hubspot-plugin.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt complements other new streamlining features like [variables](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/9823388-add-variables-to-your-presentation) — placeholders that let you automatically change content across an entire deck without going slide by slide — and library [collections](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6010928-organize-your-workspace-library), which make it easy to find assets organized according to team, client, or project.\n\n## Create a branded experience with custom domains\n\nImagine you’re sending a new client a link to your pitch room. While we personally think the pitch.com domain’s pretty awesome, we get that a custom URL can seem more professional and does a better job of showing you’re in control.\n\nThat’s why you can now host both your decks and deal rooms on a subdomain of your own site, providing a truly branded experience. There are many ways you could put this to work: Reference the type of content you’re sharing (like pitch.yourname.com or slides.yourname.com), describe your team or relationship to the recipient (sales.yourname.com or partners.yourname.com), or keep it generic (sharing.yourname.com).\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1731945585/blog/pitching-platform/custom-domain.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis highly requested feature not only boosts your brand’s visibility but also reassures clients about the source and authenticity of the deck you’re sharing. It’s a little detail — but one that’ll make your presentations more effective and ensure your audience feels confident in your content.\n\n## Know what’s working with analytics\n\n[Presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics) are one of our most powerful and popular features. Insights like how many people have viewed which slides, and for how long, help teams understand who’s engaged and what part of their messaging is hitting home. \n\nNow, you can also get analytics for a whole pitch room and its content to learn what’s working, and what needs tweaking. Just like with individual presentations, you can create a link for a room, give it a custom name, add a passcode for extra security, require an email for access, and send it off to your prospect. Then sit back and see when they visit the room, open a deck, and click on an attachment or CTA.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945571/blog/pitching-platform/blog-room-analytics.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe [links overview page](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5132455-see-all-your-team-s-links-in-one-place) lets you manage all your rooms, along with the presentations you’ve shared, in one place. That way, you can quickly share a link, control access, or track who has engaged with each room to tailor your follow-up and improve your content.\n\n## Engage your audience with interactive decks\n\nA pitch room isn’t complete without a pitch deck, right? But not just any deck — it needs to stand out. For too long, presentations have been trapped in the same old formula: headlines, bullet points, images, and maybe a chart or two. That’s why, earlier this year, we launched our [embeds](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5669613-embed-content-into-your-slides) feature, allowing you to insert dynamic content from thousands of external sites directly into your slides. \n\nEmbeds don’t just make your decks pop. They also focus your audience’s attention and create a seamless pitching experience. (Yes, there’s a theme here.)\n\nWant to turn the sales process into a true dialogue? Build a [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/try/typeformbrand/?gclsrc=aw.ds\u0026\u0026tf_campaign=EUROPE-Brand-Core-English-Combined_18008307788\u0026tf_source=google\u0026tf_medium=paid\u0026tf_content=150888936711_654632140542\u0026tf_term=typeform\u0026tf_dv=c\u0026tf_matchtype=e\u0026tf_location=9043099\u0026gad_source=1\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwwae1BhC_ARIsAK4JfryWAi8OXR-lpUF-bevF_bia2DLDTjoTV1aIFDYdffLRwkE9Rnt2BfIaArTFEALw_wcB\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds) survey or HubSpot form right into your deck.

Along the way, we’ve been adopted by [over one (now two!) million teams](https://pitch.com/blog/one-million-teams). We’ve [dabbled in AI](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0) and [finessed our UI](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-2-0-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-products-redesign). And we’ve celebrated many other feature releases, like our gallery of [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) and integrations with the wider pitching stack, including the likes of HubSpot, [Slack](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-app-for-slack), and [Notion](https://pitch.com/blog/present-async-in-your-notion-workspace).\n\nToday, we’re proud to trailblaze the tools that’ll empower you to deliver an end-to-end pitching experience to your customers. On top of our existing design, collaboration, and analytics capabilities, the new features and broader scope gives you everything you need to pitch smarter, close deals faster, and fuel your business growth. \n\nIn 2025, we’ll keep building and refining to make good on our promise of being the complete pitching platform. In the end, though, it’s not just about the updates we release but the impact we make on our users’ lives. So [we’d love to hear your feedback](https://pitch.com/community).

Today, we’re rolling out the first creator profiles, so I’d like to explain what they’re for, highlight our first group of creators, and share what’s next in our plan. \n\nEvery day, more than 30 million presentations are created. There is an incredible opportunity to build something useful for the people making these presentations: something that helps them unlock knowledge, facilitate exchange, and inspire. When it’s easy to publish great thinking, teams around the world stay better informed, make better decisions, and achieve more.\n\nPitch is breathing new life into presentations, and we want to give people the best platform to achieve more with their ideas. Since last year, my team has been working to build a full publishing ecosystem within Pitch so anyone can share and discover world-class presentation content. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1624706799/blog/1_Big_image_TemplatePage_w1200_faster.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1624706801/blog/1_Big_image_TemplatePage_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nToday, I’m excited to announce two major updates as we pursue that goal. Here’s what’s new:\n\n* We’re introducing **creator profiles**. With these new dedicated pages, creators and brands can showcase their best templates and presentations and establish an online presence with their own page and username on Pitch. Today we’ll share the first ones, and later this year, you'll be able to create your very own.\n* We’re also **opening applications for our upcoming presentation publishing beta**. As we roll out access over the coming months, we’re looking for contributors.\n\n## Introducing the first creator profiles\n\nTo start, we’ve assembled a diverse group of 25 subject matter experts across topics like user research, fundraising, sales, and design and turned their knowledge into 33 ready-to-use templates. Just like other [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) in our gallery, these combine storytelling and great design to help anyone communicate more effectively. Here are a few of the new templates you can start working with right away:\n\n## Meg Lewis — Personal Pitch Deck\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1624706722/blog/Article_Visual_Meg-_1600_px.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs a freelancer with a varied skillset (she’s a designer and a comedian, among other talents), Meg Lewis is an expert in communicating her unique abilities to prospective clients.

We’re now accepting applications for our next group of creators. For our presentation publishing beta, which will kick off this year, we’ll be focusing on storytellers.\n\nEarly participants will get the first look at publishing and community features, and have a chance to play a founding role in shaping the product. We’re especially interested in presentations covering topics relevant to growing teams, like fundraising, hiring, marketing, business development, and design.\n\nSince the beginning, we’ve been inspired to see what people have created with Pitch and how they’re pushing the boundaries of what presentations can do. We can’t wait to give that same spirit of innovation and creativity the dedicated home it deserves. Throughout the beta, we’ll be documenting our journey and building in public. \u003ca href=\"https://pitch.com/community\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFollow along and join the conversation in our community.\u003c/a\u003e\n\n*Update: Note that we’re no longer accepting applicants to the publishing beta.

Let them spark your imagination, and discover tips and templates to help you start building your own creative showcase.\n\n## 1. Koto\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/d9c32bbe-70e4-44a9-b40d-48bd4b940a69\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAccording to [Koto](https://koto.studio/)’s website, their namesake is a Japanese word describing an emotional experience that goes beyond pure aesthetics. That’s Koto’s motto: Create work that looks good and makes you feel something. The first few slides of Koto’s deck visually set the stage for their design direction and expertise — they’ve worked with some of the biggest companies and pluckiest startups on brand and digital projects. Using bento box–style slide layouts to share a range of visuals without it feeling overwhelming, Koto lets their case studies speak for themselves. Sections dedicated to projects for Bolt, Whatsapp, and Airtasker feature logos, animations, digital mockups, copy, and more to highlight the breadth of their skills.\\\n\\\nThis modern, customizable [design portfolio](https://pitch.com/templates/Design-Portfolio-4mkELV2TMKDP5VhYaD4XTSx6) template contains ample space to organize your work and share your accomplishments with prospective clients.\n\n## 2. Here\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/6ad56e8b-ebbf-468e-abf0-2448d078f73c\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Here](https://www.heredesign.com/)’s creds deck is a narrative that weaves together past, present, and future. We’re greeted by a futuristic visual and succinct About section, which leads into a slide highlighting the agency’s [B-corp certification](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/) — an indication of their commitment to social and environmental issues. Right off the bat, we have insight into Here’s work and values. Up next are their case studies, which include historical context on projects with the likes of Glenfiddich and The Balvenie. Sci-fiesque animations play on tradition to reinterpret the brands for the present day. The deck culminates with Here’s work on London Craft Week, where we come full circle to the same futuristic visuals used at the start.\\\n\\\nA portfolio isn’t just a vehicle to deliver your creative work — it informs how people understand that work, and is a project in its own right. Tell a story with ethereal visual elements like the ones in our versatile [Prisma](https://pitch.com/templates/Prisma-2BvhdQ2WEbr55Lf99n5TmNKi) and [concept proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Concept-Proposal-00fCwy2fiSrK5PCZ9W4y1H8J) templates, or draw inspiration from this [marketing proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Marketing-Proposal-6BazfH6AcfE45PJr5i5oE3qM)’s dreamy animations.\n\n## 3. Studio Treble\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9ac9227a-2cf5-4d18-94a7-d87a7fa54c39\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Studio Treble](https://www.studiotreble.com/)’s skills in graphic, digital, and motion design are underscored from the get-go. Their cover slide puts the spotlight on a sophisticated animation that unfolds into a colorful, structured deck featuring the team, their practice, standout work examples, and cost estimates to kick off a conversation. Discussing pricing isn’t always a step creatives want to take upfront, but Studio Treble’s openness and transparency about their process can build confidence with prospects who appreciate attention to detail. The team’s deck makes it clear they’ll deliver, from initial immersion through ideation to final rollout.\\\n\\\nTo create a bold visual language with recurring colors and shapes like Studio Treble, try this [personal branding pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Personal-Branding-Pitch-Deck-5j8DRt6zzLUa5JqPED6gWtP4) — or use this [design agency pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Design-Agency-Pitch-Deck-4CNqag4fidYd5p29KQ7L9D18) to share your approach, showcase your work and milestones, lay out pricing details, and highlight client testimonials. \n\n## 4. David Bonàs\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/e9e8ccdf-863c-4e76-acfe-366d8fc90ff7\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis personal portfolio helped land [David Bonàs](https://pitch.com/u/davidbonas) the role of Head of Brand Design at Pitch. David’s broad and impressive experience is presented through case studies that don’t just show the final output, but delve into his own contribution toward each project. While agency work often assumes full ownership, individual portfolios can benefit from this kind of context-setting. David’s slides also explain the thinking behind the direction and decisions he made, acting like a beautiful and highly engaging CV.\\\n\\\nSimilarly, designer Emiland De Cubber got his first job thanks to a presentation. Adapted from his personal CV, this [modern resume](https://pitch.com/templates/Resume-Modern-6hhg796EvthT5BRWFa3579jC) template can serve as a springboard to help you land your dream job. You could also consider [using recordings to enhance your portfolio with personality](https://pitch.com/use-cases/video-presentation-maker) and provide context for your work. \n\n## 5. Planes\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/e053abb1-06ac-447a-8000-4a3221455d3b\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Planes](https://www.planes.studio/)’ portfolio deck sets the tone with a compelling pitch: It outlines the challenges businesses face, and how the agency fits into that landscape as a solution. It then backs up this claim with an overview of the team’s process, stats, project types, and expertise. The deck demonstrates each of these facets through case studies, which go beyond pure visuals — Planes includes the impact of their campaign launches in terms of downloads and reach, creating confidence in their work and success. The overall deck design feels both contemporary and nostalgic, in a way that’s firmly grounded in the space between reality and imagination.\\\n\\\nAre you a fan of ’90s aesthetics? Take a design cue from our [Made in the '90s](https://pitch.com/templates/Made-in-the-90s-7Ct6EB2HWKFo5d3KFv61Xayn) template with its black and white grid, pastel colors, geometric shapes, and hairy patterns (RIP MTV).\n\n## 6. Forty Eight Point One\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/5f05bdf6-d136-4146-95bb-d3b84993278f\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Forty Eight Point One](https://fortyeight.one/)’s deck begins with their origin story, which in turn acts as an introduction to their creative approach. Rather than jumping directly into case studies, they have a nice segue slide that lists some of the names they’ve worked with, along with a short blurb on why those partners were a match made in heaven — because Forty Eight Point One gravitates toward brands that are future-facing and undertaking transformational projects. They then highlight work examples, from digital products to copy and lifestyle campaigns, deftly conveying a sense of their scope in the process.\\\n\\\nThis free [architecture portfolio](https://pitch.com/templates/Architecture-Portfolio-41o1nN2XeYkt4qrY950iijRR) template can easily be adapted to any creative field. Use it to introduce yourself to potential clients, share your philosophy and approach, and showcase your best work.\n\n## 7. Letterboy\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/780d95b2-dc17-4ccf-832b-b6a4d9123cdf\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Letterboy](http://www.letter-boy.com/)’s deck is a great example of a portfolio-slash-think piece from an individual. It unveils the brain behind the brand — the person, his design process, and his past work. Offering a detailed look into hand-drawn type, the presentation is, in a way, a love letter to the medium and its benefits in the digital age. It draws viewers into Letterboy’s world, so they can understand his work in context and pause to appreciate the time and effort it takes to create unique fonts and flourishes by hand.\\\n\\\nWith multiple slide layouts to showcase your achievements, this bold [design portfolio](https://pitch.com/templates/Graphic-Design-Portfolio-Bold-5HyDDr7VNrs75UrfkX3zQrVW) template is flexible enough to work for any visual creative, from graphic designers and illustrators to architects and fashion designers.\n\n## Get started on your winning portfolio\n\nYour portfolio is your ticket to connecting with potential clients and collaborators. As we’ve seen, portfolios can take many shapes and focus on different parts of their creators’ story: the team, approach, areas of expertise, unique selling points, key stats, pricing, process, and, of course, examples of amazing work. \n\nThe creative possibilities are endless. That said, with any portfolio, it’s good practice to include contact info and a CTA at the end.

As a designer, you know the effort (and caffeine) that goes into crafting the perfect pitch. So how do you streamline your process and rise above the tired text-and-image deck format to impress your peers? Easy: embrace the freshest tech.\n\nNot to toot our own horn, but Pitch knows a thing or two about design. We’re constantly tweaking details to [provide a sleeker user experience](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-2-0-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-products-redesign) and crafting new features that raise the bar for presentations. Now, you can tell a richer story with less effort by embedding content from external sites into your slides. Whether you’re animating a key point, showcasing a 3D design, or presenting a prototype, interactive elements bring your deck to life and give you new ways to engage both clients and team members.\n\nReady to elevate your next creative pitch? See how embedding dynamic content into your deck can generate buzz, improve collaboration, and win over even the most skeptical audience.\n\n## Workshop your design direction with prototypes\n\nPlot twists might be thrilling in mystery novels, but pitching is a different story. As a designer, you know that transparency is key — sharing frequent updates on your work is part of the process, whether it’s for an internal review or an external client presentation.\n\nMaybe you need to present a mockup to your team to explain how a product, webpage, or promotional piece will look. Or say an account manager is going through a quarterly review deck with a client, and wants to get their thoughts on a new feature before it’s fully developed. Similarly, a creative director might use wireframes to get feedback on an upcoming campaign before investing in higher fidelity designs.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169342/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-prototype.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169729/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-prototype-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEmbedding prototypes from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/xd/get-started.html), [Miro](https://miro.com/), and [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) into your decks can transform the way you collaborate on project slides. It allows you to control the experience while building trust and buy-in, so everyone stays aligned — and you save yourself extra work down the line.\n\n## Drive collaboration with live files\n\nAlong with presenting your in-progress designs, sometimes you need to share actual files of logos, headshots, or brand assets. Traditionally, you might have added a link to a PNG. But in doing so, you’d lead people away from your deck and redirect their attention. \n\nIn Pitch, you can simply embed the files — or whole folders — into your slides to keep the experience seamless and ensure the latest version is always at hand.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169342/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-designs.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169727/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-designs-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe same goes for other assets stored outside your presentation. You can easily integrate files from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) to keep everything streamlined and up-to-date.\n\n## Focus your audience’s attention with animations \n\nWhen it comes to making your decks pop, animations are a power move. First off, they’re visually appealing. But they can also make complex ideas crystal clear… if you play your cards right.\n\nThanks to the [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/) integration in Pitch, you can quickly insert GIFs and stickers with transparent backgrounds into your slides. Additionally, try embedding animations from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) or [Rive](https://rive.app/) to highlight points, annotate content, or just make your slides more fun.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169338/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-animation.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169726/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-animation-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch also offers classic effects like fade and shrink, [block animations](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/7958562-add-animations-to-a-presentation), and the continuity transition. Text, images, videos, embeds, and shapes float and shift as you move between slides, keeping your narrative flowing and your audience hooked.\n\n## Bring your vision to life with 3D models\n\nSay you want to spotlight a 3D file, whether it’s an architectural rendering for a new building, a sleek automotive feature, an industrial product prototype, or an innovative fashion concept. Redirecting your audience to a separate tool to view the model can break the momentum of your presentation — and muddy your vision.\n\nThat’s why embedding 3D designs directly into your slides is a game-changer. With tools like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and [Vntana](https://www.vntana.com/), it’s easy to incorporate high-quality 3D content into your Pitch deck. [Vectary](https://www.vectary.com/) is great if you want a simple, collaborative tool to create and share 3D designs with your team.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169338/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-3d.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169726/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-3d-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis lets you seamlessly engage with your 3D model in real time — or your audience can explore it on their own if you’re sharing the deck async. Plus, you can animate your embedded models for an extra layer of visual impact.\n\n## Jumpstart creative thinking with moodboards\n\nImagine you’re working on a creative campaign or exploring fresh branding ideas. You’ve probably gathered a treasure trove of inspiration, right? Moodboards and visual references are another smart way to share your design thinking and supercharge collaboration in your decks. \n\nBy embedding moodboards alongside your final output, you draw viewers into your creative journey and help them understand your process. If you’re still in the ideation phase, it also means your team and clients can smoothly transition from brainstorming to polished proposals — all within the same presentation.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169338/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-moodboard.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169728/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-moodboard-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nInstead of juggling between different tools, effortlessly weave visual inspiration from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) directly into your Pitch deck.\n\n## Demonstrate real-world impact with social media\n\nOften, gaining buy-in isn’t about reinventing the wheel but demonstrating you’re on the right track. If you’re in the brainstorming phase of a new campaign or reimagining your brand, displaying a range of social media posts can lend credibility and show that your vision aligns with proven success.\n\nBreathe life into your concepts and offer a clear view of how your ideas play out in the real world by embedding posts from [X](https://x.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/?hl=en) into your deck. You can also add videos from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) to boost your social proof.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169340/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-social.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169727/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-social-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhether you’re highlighting past campaign successes or drawing inspiration from others, this approach means you skip the hassle of toggling between platforms — and your team and clients get a complete picture. \n\n## Set the tone with audio files\n\nDesign isn’t just about visuals — sound plays a crucial role too. Embedding audio files in your decks can elevate your content, whether you’re showcasing an ad campaign soundtrack or previewing a video narration.\n\nSometimes, the audio itself is the deliverable, like a custom track created for a client’s media needs. Or maybe you want to share podcast snippets or other spoken content on your slides to create a certain vibe during a project proposal.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1727169342/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-audio.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1727169727/blog/Design%20standout%20decks%20with%20dynamic%20content/blog-embed-audio-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYou can easily pull audio into your Pitch deck from [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [Spotify](https://spotify.com/), or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/). To edit and fine-tune your tracks, check out [Descript](https://www.descript.com/). By setting the right tone, you’ll turn a decent presentation into a memorable experience — and move closer to sealing the deal.\n\n## Elevate your next pitch with interactive elements\n\nDesign and collaboration are at the heart of everything we do at Pitch. Now that you know what’s possible, are you ready to bring your ideas to life and build a dynamic feedback culture? \n\nTo get started, [sign up for a Pitch account](https://app.pitch.com/?signup) and choose a fully customizable template from our gallery, or work from a blank slate. Then, [embedding content into your deck is a breeze](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5669613-embed-content-into-your-slides). Just click on the **Embed** icon and drop your URL into the text field. Once you’ve added an embed, you can change its opacity and resize, reposition, and rotate it until you’re happy with the result. \n\nAnd that’s it!

In this post, we'll walk you through how we design presentations at Pitch, from initial brainstorming to revisions and finally, the finished product.\n\nWe create hundreds of presentations a month. While many are for our own internal needs, quite a few of the presentations we create at Pitch are [templates](https://pitch.com/templates). These could be anything from an [SEO report](https://pitch.com/templates/SEO-Report-5xZdZD0FvgdS4mRDru3m5fGW) to a template for a company’s [brand guidelines](https://pitch.com/templates/Brand-Guidelines-7TsUZF24p3Lp54xk454zZ5Ve). Quite a lot of research and thinking goes into the creation of each and every one of them and, as a result, we’ve developed a dedicated method for designing them. Here’s how we approach the process.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/tee_post_templates_rdx4w1.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_templates.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 1. Discovery\n\nThis phase focuses on research and inspiration. We start with two fundamental questions: why are we building this template, and who are we building it for?\n\nThis helps us better understand the stakeholders or personas who may typically use this template. When doing research, we like to speak to those who do a lot of presentations on the topic, like VCs and founders for pitch deck or design agencies for brand guidelines. We ask them what they would find useful and what kind of slides they consider critical to telling their story. We also look internally to see if we have any templates on the topic that we use time and time again.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_books.jpg] [alt:presentation design inspiration] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGathering visual inspiration isn't much different than finding inspiration for designing anything else. There are obvious online showcases such as SiteInspire, Dribbble, and Behance, but my favorite places to browse are bookstores. Books offer a ton of design inspiration, from elaborate, highly visual coffee table books to aged almanacs and history documents. They’re also a good resource for seeing how people lay out information in restricted spaces, which later helps me when I'm trying to figure out how to handle dense blocks of text or what kind of white space is right for a particular slide.\n\n## 2. Outline\n\nOutlining is a big, big part of the process. Especially when it comes to slides, you have just a little room to get a lot across. Plus, a template is only useful if it can be used multiple times. This means content and design should be collaborating from the early stages. In our case, I work with our content people to nail the copy before I place it in on slides. For this stage, we tend to work in plain text. This way, I’m not distracted by visuals, and it leaves room to move things around for the best structure or storyline.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/tee_post_outline_xdmy6f.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/1_groundup.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 3. Visual Exploration\n\nIt helps to try and go in completely different directions during this phase. How can you know that your first direction is the right one? Try to answer the above questions in different answers, and use those answers to guide the directions you explore.\n\nHere’s an example of the Brand Guidelines template during the exploration phase. From the previous step, I’ve duplicated the exact same content but started designing them in two different directions. The first exploration is more graphic-based. It features the IBM Plex super family which has a nice balance between humanist and tech. The base colors are black and white and we threw in a bold color for a little excitement. The second exploration relies a bit more on photography and a much more subdued and calmer color scheme.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_big_1.jpg] [alt:directions for brand guidelines template design] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe design our templates to serve as a visual example, knowing the majority of the content will be replaced. Designing [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) to be used by other brands is a bit of a unique situation. In the end, templates like Brand Guidelines will be completely customized. We know that most of our templates will be replaced by another company's style, but showing different layout styles and examples of how to get creative with the content will inspire our users with how they can get started and make decks uniquely their own.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_stylebuilder.jpg] [alt:pitch style builder] [caption:We ensure consistency by defining font and colors in our style builder, then saving it to our workspace. ] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 4. Feedback\n\nI usually develop two to three design directions for each template, which I share on Slack, in our weekly Design Review meeting, and our company Team Bulletin for feedback. Here’s an example of two directions I was working through for our Minimalist template.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/comparison-minimal-w1200-.jpg] [alt:minimal presentation template examples] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThey’re both pretty simple, and I tried to adhere to a grayscale color palette to support the visual theme. The first direction uses three different typefaces and has a thin white border around images, the second direction uses just one typeface with full screen images. I threw this in our #design channel to ask for feedback. Here are some of the thoughts they shared:\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_slack.jpg] [alt:asking for design feedback in slack] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis example is pretty typical: Some people had very specific feedback, while others were more vague. As any designer knows, people’s opinions can often contradict one another. Figuring out why they prefer one direction over another will help you weed out the comments that will be useful for you when moving forward. “This one just looks nicer” won’t be as helpful as “The text here reads better and the colors will attract our target audience more.”\n\nAsking more specific questions can help guide the person you’re asking to give a more helpful answer. In this example, we decided to continue with the second direction as we agreed that using just one font family and less visual decoration better supported the concept of minimalism.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“When asking for opinions, it’s so important to figure out the why.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 5. Reiterate\n\nChances are, you probably won’t nail it on the first try. When it’s time to refine or re-visit the design of one of our templates, I try to refer to the feedback and understand what will be practically helpful when creating revisions. We usually have at least three people working on every presentation: a designer, copywriter, and project manager or other stakeholder.\n\nAnd with so many people involved, the revision stage could get messy if we had multiple versions of files scattered in the cloud or lost on someone’s desktop. Luckily in Pitch, we can easily track the status of slides and assign them to specific people to complete.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee_post_comments.jpg] [alt:agency pitch deck design] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is our process for creating templates that don’t just look great but are actually useful when putting together a presentation. But this process isn’t unique to [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips), and you probably go through something similar when designing logos, websites, etc. I think there’s something to be said about that: This design approach just works.

But you’re not here for gimmicky solutions — you need something that delivers real, lasting results.\n\nSound familiar? Enter the digital sales room. \n\nWhat exactly is a digital sales room, and why does it matter to you? You’re about to find out — plus, get a few tips on how to elevate your digital sales room and gain an edge over the competition.\n\n## What’s a digital sales room?\n\nGrowing revenue today means pitching repeatedly across multiple stages, with slides that adapt while staying on brand and on message. And that’s only the start. Modern pitching has grown more intricate, demanding a personalized, interactive, and data-driven approach. To seal the deal, you need to deliver a seamless, end-to-end experience. \n\nThat’s where the digital sales room, or DSR, comes in. \n\nSales microsite, content hub, deal room, pitch room — a DSR may go by many names, but it’s essentially a secure online platform where businesses can share tailored content with prospects or clients, monitor engagement, and work together to close deals more quickly. These centralized B2B hubs make it easy to collaborate and streamline the entire sales process so your customers can find what they need and *you* can stay organized.\n\n## Is a digital sales room right for me?\n\nIn today’s buying journey, static documents and links buried in email threads feel out of place. Anyone involved in selling a product or service can benefit from using a DSR to keep up momentum, improve content curation, gain insights into stakeholder interests, and use those insights to better control the sales process. \n\nLet’s look at each of these scenarios in more detail.\n\n### Speed up long sales cycles\n\nA B2B sales cycle might not literally involve running 26.2 miles, but it can certainly feel like a marathon. A digital sales room makes the process faster — it keeps your buyers on track, guiding them smoothly and quickly to the finish line so you can focus on closing new deals.\n\n### Centralize your content\n\nYou might be used to chasing email threads for lost attachments, resending updated assets, or juggling multiple platforms. A DSR cuts through the chaos, giving you one cohesive hub to store, share, and manage all your sales content.\n\n### Get insights into client behavior\n\nEver stared at your inbox or CRM, wondering what your prospects were thinking on the other end? There’s a better way. A great digital sales room gives you real-time analytics, offering insights into how visitors are interacting with your content so you can act strategically.\n\n### Boost buyer engagement\n\nWe all know it’s tough to keep customers engaged. A digital sales room offers a tailored, interactive space where your team can leverage engagement analytics to deliver the most relevant materials at the perfect moment, making clients feel valued every step of the way.\n\nThere’s a catch, though: Not all digital sales rooms are created equal. \n\n## The problem with traditional DSRs\n\nCreating a digital sales room is a great first step. But as anyone who’s ever signed a new apartment lease knows, an empty room’s not all that useful, is it? You need to furnish it — in this case, with content personalized to your customers’ preferences. \n\nTraditionally, you’d rely on multiple tools to create the materials your pitching process requires: We’re talking slide decks, documents like order forms and terms, meeting recordings, scheduling links, videos, etc. Your marketing and sales teams would work with different platforms. Your PowerPoint decks would pass back and forth between stakeholders who needed to weigh in. Every time someone updated a fact or figure, a new version would be created. Keeping your DSR up to date would be a constant hassle. \n\nSticking to the status quo makes it easy to lose sight of what’s happening, creates inconsistencies, and wastes time on all sides. \n\n## Level up your DSR with an all-in-one solution\n\nWithout alignment, DSRs can feel chaotic. That’s why Pitch’s digital sales rooms — or **pitch rooms**, as we call them — are different. With Pitch, teams can create stunning decks and drive client interactions within a single, unified workflow *[for the first time ever](https://pitch.com/blog/complete-pitching-platform)*.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945572/blog/pitching-platform/blog-pitch-rooms.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1738746427/blog/pitching-platform/blog-pitch-rooms-still.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGoodbye siloed processes, hello streamlined efficiency.

Meanwhile, your prospects are greeted with a sleek, personalized room curated with professional-grade decks that are always up to date.\n\n## 6 ways to elevate your digital sales room\n\nLeveraging the power of a pitch room can change the way you sell, making it more organized, efficient, and impactful. Want to discover just what makes Pitch the [top digital sales room](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/10134438-share-pitch-rooms-with-prospects-or-clients) solution? Here are six ways it stands out from the crowd. \n\n### 1. Engage your audience with interactive decks\n\nA pitch room isn’t complete without a sales deck, right? But not just any deck — it needs to stand out. Pitch makes it easy to start with [professionally designed templates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales) that you can customize to match your client’s branding, or you can [build a template from scratch](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3752837-create-a-template). \n\nTo wow clients from the get-go, leverage the [embeds feature](https://pitch.com/blog/win-deals-with-interactive-sales-decks), allowing you to insert dynamic content from thousands of external sites directly into your slides. Want to turn the sales process into a true dialogue? Build a [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/try/typeformbrand/?gclsrc=aw.ds\u0026\u0026tf_campaign=EUROPE-Brand-Core-English-Combined_18008307788\u0026tf_source=google\u0026tf_medium=paid\u0026tf_content=150888936711_654632140542\u0026tf_term=typeform\u0026tf_dv=c\u0026tf_matchtype=e\u0026tf_location=9043099\u0026gad_source=1\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwwae1BhC_ARIsAK4JfryWAi8OXR-lpUF-bevF_bia2DLDTjoTV1aIFDYdffLRwkE9Rnt2BfIaArTFEALw_wcB\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds) survey or HubSpot form right into your deck. Need to present a prototype from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)? Embed it in a slide. Whether you’re demoing a product, sharing a personalized video [recording](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings), or booking a discovery call, embeds bring decks to life, give you more control over the pitching process, and help you [win deals](https://email.hi.pitch.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). \n\nBecause Pitch is a web-first application, everyone sees the same thing in real time, and team members can [leave comments on slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments) for others to review async. The best part, though? Changes are saved automatically. That means [no more final_final_final_v1](https://pitch.com/pitch-vs-powerpoint), and your prospects are always presented with up-to-date information.\n\n### 2. Curate a sleek content hub\n\nBy creating a DSR in Pitch, you’ll never need to scramble for the right content or dig through emails for that elusive attachment. Your pitch room keeps everything — slide decks, videos, and links — in one sleek, accessible hub. Sales reps can locate the materials they need in seconds while buyers get the right resources at the right time, leading to productive conversations and quicker decisions.\n\nThink of a tidy toolbox, where every tool has a place and purpose. In the same way, each sales asset in your room should have a designated spot and present key information that’ll improve communication and streamline decision-making. Need to reshuffle your pitch room’s content or update it as the deal progresses? Simply drag and drop presentations, links, and files to feature the most important resources upfront. \n\nYou can also use the preview button to experience your pitch rooms before sharing and ensure every detail is pixel-perfect. \n\n### 3. Autofill a pitch room from your CRM\n\nHow do you keep your sales process flowing smoothly and ensure nothing falls through the cracks? Simple — stick to one platform. If you’re a customer-facing team, chances are you spend a lot of time in your CRM. To make life easier, we’ve created a couple of handy plugins that let you build a pitch room without ever leaving your workflow.\n\nWith the Pitch apps for [HubSpot](https://pitch.com/integrations/hubspot) and [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), you can prefill a room with content, automatically populating it with customer data. Once you’re all set, you can then share the room’s link and password directly from the CRM, or jump into Pitch to edit your assets.\n\n### 4. Create a branded experience\n\nAn effective DSR will make your client feel like they’re stepping into a familiar space, designed specifically for them. To that end, you can customize your digital sales room by incorporating logos, colors, and styles that reflect both your brands.\n\nWith Pitch, you can also take it a step further by hosting deal rooms on a subdomain of your own site, providing a truly branded experience. Whether you use your URL to reference the type of content you’re sharing or to describe your team or relationship to the recipient, the room will feel personal and intentional.\n\nThis feature not only boosts your brand’s visibility but also reassures clients about the source and authenticity of the rooms you’re sharing. It’s a little detail — but one that’ll make your pitches more powerful, ensure your audience feels confident in your content, and increase your chances of winning them over.\n\n### 5. Stay ahead of the game with engagement analytics\n\nTiming is everything in sales. With Pitch’s powerful engagement analytics, you’ll know exactly what your clients are viewing, how long they’re spending on each resource, and where they’re most engaged — so you can follow up at just the right moment.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945571/blog/pitching-platform/blog-room-analytics.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1738746160/blog/pitching-platform/blog-room-analytics-still.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGet analytics for a whole pitch room and its content to see what’s resonating and what might need adjusting. Just like with individual presentations, you can generate a custom link for your room, add a passcode for extra security, require an email for access, and send it off to your prospect. Then, get real-time insights when anyone from their team visits, opens a deck, or clicks on an attachment or CTA.\n\nThe [links overview page](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5132455-see-all-your-team-s-links-in-one-place) keeps all your rooms and shared presentations organized in one place, making it easy to track engagement and manage access with just a few clicks.\n\n### 6. Keep the communication flowing\n\nAre you (and your customers) tired of emails getting lost in the shuffle or landing with the wrong people? The pitch room reduces friction with features you can use to point your audience to the right contacts and channels, so you can keep the conversation going. \n\nWelcome prospects with a personalized note and point of contact so they know who to talk to anytime there’s a question. Add a clear contact button to make it even easier for visitors to book a call or send an email. That said, you don’t need to wait for your prospects to reach out — use engagement insights to time your outreach and invite them to a 1:1 when they seem most interested. By proactively managing your communication, you’ll get faster responses, fewer delays, and a smoother path to closing the deal.\n\nNow that you have a better sense of what sets Pitch apart, let’s dive into how you can tailor your digital sales room for every stage of the buyer journey.\n\n## How do pitch rooms evolve through the sales journey?\n\nDigital sales rooms enhance the sales process by offering a curated space where buyers can access information at their own pace. Maybe you need to onboard new clients with helpful videos and slides, or deliver creative assets to customers at the close of a project. The key is to understand where your prospects are in their journey — whether it’s at the top, middle, bottom of the funnel, or post-sale — and use a DSR to guide them through each stage.\n\n### Step 1: Impress and inform prospects\n\nAt the start of their journey, potential customers are focused on gathering information, not making a purchase — so don’t flood your pitch room with a lot of overwhelming content. Instead, carefully curate your materials based on each prospect’s needs.\n\nThis is the perfect time to wow and educate rather than push for a sale. Populate your room with a captivating deck featuring [informative embeds](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5669613-embed-content-into-your-slides), [animated content](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/7958562-add-animations-to-a-presentation) to enhance your message, and a pricing proposal. Be sure to include a contact button, and add a meeting form to your deck to make it easy for prospects to reach out with questions.\n\n### Step 2: Build trust with tailored content\n\nYour prospects now have the essentials and are comparing their options. Now’s the moment to elevate their experience by upping your tailored content. Turn your DSR into a dynamic hub featuring product demos, relevant case studies, and comparisons that directly answer their questions.\n\nEngagement data is your best friend here. If a visitor lingers on a specific product feature, take the opportunity to schedule a quick follow-up call or dive deeper into that topic. With this data, you can adjust your content and proactively offer the ideal follow-up. \n\n### Step 3: Clear the way to success\n\nYour potential customers have all the details they need and are ready to make a decision. At this stage, your digital sales room becomes a real-time collaboration hub where you can work closely with prospects to solve their challenges and secure that signature.\n\nNow, it’s all about removing any last-minute roadblocks before they derail progress. Provide everything your prospects need, from pricing to contracts, and be ready to tackle any questions or concerns to keep things moving in the right direction. Here again, engagement analytics data can help you step in at the perfect moment and sail to the finish line. \n\n### Step 4: Nurture your relationship for future growth\n\nYou won the deal, congrats! But a signature isn’t an end in itself — it’s an opportunity to set the stage for even more wins in the future. The digital sales room is now your tool to keep that momentum alive. \n\nSet your new customer up for success by creating an onboarding room, or help them unlock more value over time by adding product updates, exclusive offers, and sneak peeks at new features. Stay connected by collecting feedback, fostering community conversations, or cocreating content. This ongoing engagement will strengthen your customers’ loyalty — and may even reveal new upsell opportunities down the road.\n\n## Discover the power of Pitch\n\nSince 2020, Pitch has been empowering users to share bold ideas and grow.

By day, he’s a marketing manager at Twitter, but on the side, he pursues a unique passion. It was sparked by pure chance, it blossomed out of necessity, and once, he even went viral for it.\n\nEmiland is a self-trained slide designer.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1622548338/blog/Emiland_portrait.png] [alt:Emiland de Cubber slide designer] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHailing from France, the 32-year-old traces the start of his serendipitous journey to his experiences as a boy in the ‘90s. Like many kids his age, Emiland found an interest in skateboarding. But just as his newfound passion was gaining speed, his family moved to the countryside. His new whereabouts: a small town with only around 500 inhabitants, with country roads worn down by tractors and caked with mud. Suddenly, skating was out of the question.\n\nSo with a friend he’d made who shared his dreams of well-kept asphalt, he decided to try to change things: “The town center already had a recreation park with a basketball court, so we thought we might convince the town’s employees to help us build a simple skatepark. I talked to my parents, and they said we ought to pitch the mayor on the idea.”\n\nThis was Emiland’s first encounter with presentations. \n\n“Both my parents worked for Bull, a European computer company that was big at the time, so my father borrowed an old slideshow projector from his office and brought it home on the weekend so we could rehearse,” he remembers.\n\n“It was terrible...but super authentic. We even recorded the sound of our own skateboards and uploaded them as handmade sound transitions,” he says.\n\nSlides in hand, along with pricing catalogs from skatepark suppliers and a Lego model of a potential design, Emiland and his friend took their idea to the town hall. Not used to being pitched on city planning by kids, the council members liked it, and invited them back to share their idea at a meeting of neighboring town administrators in a few weeks.\n\nSadly, that was more or less the end of the road — Emiland’s asphalt pipe dream ran into the brick wall of local politics, as the city council decided the skatepark would attract the wrong crowd. His passion shifted away from skateboard decks, but his journey with slide decks had just started.\n\nAs one of [the first creators on Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/creator-profiles-the-future-of-publishing), Emiland pays homage to his childhood’s influence on his deck design with a ’90s inspired template: \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/99b71180-fc2c-4030-812f-515e520378f6?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\u003e *Get this presentation and more. [Check out all of Emiland's presentations on Pitch.](https://pitch.com/u/emiland)*\n\n## A step ahead\n\nEmiland’s skatepark proposal had given him an edge that would prove handy over the next few years: He knew [how to make slides](https://pitch.com/use-cases/slideshow-maker) just a little bit better than everyone else his age. In his university years, whenever working on team projects, he found a natural role as the leader on the presentations to be submitted to his professors. \n\nHe also discovered his niche talent had the potential for big rewards.\n\n“At the time, companies would organize pitch contests for students with a prize,” Emiland says. “It always came down to two projects that had been finished by students at midnight the night before, and the one with the best [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips) always won, so friends and I always entered. We won iPods, iPads — our projects were honestly not that much better than the others, but our presentations were better.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"Our projects were honestly not that much better than the others, but our presentations were better.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEmiland reaches for an expression from French literature: “Ce que l'on concoit bien s'enonce clairement, et les mots pour le dire arrivent aisement.” (“Whatever we conceive well we express clearly, and words flow with ease.”)\n\n“Think about how it applies to presentations,” he says. \"Your project won’t look good if you can’t express it very clearly.”\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1622536349/blog/smallimage_emiland.png] [alt:Emiland de Cubber the slide designer] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Tweak what you know\n\nWith a university degree under his belt, Emiland got his start in the professional world, managing accounts at marketing agencies and building social apps and games for clients. Throughout his mid-20s, slide design was just a passion, with no plan or purse strings attached.\n\nHis big break came at a conference after seeing an engaging talk sabotaged by subpar visuals.\n\n“I approached the man who presented and told him his talk was great, but would have been much better if his slides were consistent with what he said. I told him I could help. It was a pushy move but he agreed!”\n\nWith a few hundred euros in his pocket, Emiland now knew he had something more than an amateur passion — and he started to set about making a name for himself.\n\n## 15 minutes of fame on a global stage\n\nTo expand his clientele, Emiland focused on newsjacking. Many know him as the guy who redesigned the infamous slide deck by the United State’s National Security Agency (NSA).\n\n“Here was this awful scandal in terms of data and privacy, but all I could see was the ugliness of the slide. It was so cheap! I thought, ‘Is this really the spying program of the future?’”\n\nSo, Emiland took it upon himself to redesign the deck.\n\n“I did it in just one night and published it at work on my lunch break. The developers told me I should publish it on Hacker News. I didn’t know the website, but I did, and soon enough there were comments everywhere.

They thought I was some kind of activist, but I honestly had no political message, it was just for fun.”\n\nEmiland received more than 300 emails from people asking him to design their decks, but didn’t take most of the proposals. \n\n“I picked a few projects that seemed right, and had to tell most people that I appreciated the attention, but couldn’t take on their presentation. I lost a lot of opportunities for work,” he remembers. “I knew the attention was something that would only last for a few days, so I chose not to let it change my life.”\n\n## Clean slides, clean mind\n\nToday, Emiland still enjoys designing slides as much as he always has. Now, it’s a side hustle he does on nights and weekends. He sees it as a privilege to be able to pick the projects he likes. \n\n“Creating decks is not always a designer’s favorite task. Marketing and sales people know the impact of presentations but don’t know how to master it. I try to reconcile both.”\n\nSo, what is Emiland’s top tip for finding joy in slide design? Start simple. Stay simple. \n\n“Every element should struggle for its presence,” he says. “If it doesn’t add to the understanding of the slide, it should be removed.”\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch"],"title":"Every Day","visible-title":"\u0026#x1F44F; Every \u0026#x1F44F; Day \u0026#x1F44F;","date":"2022-06-13T10:10:53.411Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Adam Renklint","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115311/blog/every%20day/Header_MOBILE_Daily_Shipping_2022_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115311/blog/every%20day/Header_SMALL_Daily_Shipping_2022_1200_-1.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115312/blog/every%20day/Header_MID_Daily_Shipping_2022_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115312/blog/every%20day/Header_BIG_Daily_Shipping_2022_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115311/blog/every%20day/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Daily_Shipping_2022.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655115310/blog/every%20day/Social_share_Daily_Shipping_2022.png","teaser-text":"Our shipping cadence sets the rhythm of our business.

Moreover, it represents our commitment to delivering ongoing value to our customers. Last summer, I outlined why [shipping every week](https://pitch.com/blog/every-week) was so important to our team. At the end of May, we started shipping every business day. I’d like to share our thinking behind this change and what it means for you. \n\nWhen we founded Pitch, we made every technical decision in the interest of speed, creativity, and adaptability. But some of those decisions and processes simply couldn’t scale to keep up with our growth. \n\nWhile fast by most companies’ standards, the weekly release cycle had specific bottlenecks that slowed us down. Working toward release cut-offs, submitting and reviewing large pull requests, testing in our internal environment, and preparing each release added complexity and created room for error. Worst of all, it added a sense of stress to what should be thrilling: making Pitch better for our customers each and every week. \n\nThe move to daily releases helps us simplify key processes, reduce complexity, and improve engineering velocity. That, in turn, empowers our team to ship higher-quality code and a better product experience. \n\n## Living our engineering principles \n\nReading through our [engineering principles](https://pitch.com/presentations/Pitch-Engineering-Principles-7VBa3U6Yeit34d5N2o5hdrGG?slide=2bbf9be6-4279-42fd-98bb-50fca011dd86) lets you understand how vital iteration and collaboration are to our team. The only way we can get better at what we do is by opening ourselves up to early and frequent feedback and sharing knowledge across teams. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a58e434f-b087-4711-8dc2-abb55e36c9f8\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHowever, our previous release process made small iterations difficult, adding friction to how we collaborate — especially on code reviews and testing. Larger units of work became large pull requests, which in turn made code reviews more difficult and pushed us to rely on complex (and expensive) end-to-end automation. Inevitably, this led to situations where we discovered conflicts or errors on release days and had to shift focus toward last-minute fixes.\n\nOur new release process enables us to break down work into smaller units. With this approach, we end up creating more but smaller pull requests. When pull requests are 25 lines of code — instead of 100 — engineers can provide better reviews, and we can merge them faster with greater confidence. \n\nWhat I find most exciting about this change is that it aligns our behavior with the product we’re building. When you want to work on a presentation with a colleague, you expect to work on the same version, not a duplicate. By releasing each day, we eliminate the notion of an internal testing environment and a production environment — we work right where users use our code.\n\n## Creating a faster feedback loop with customers\n\nYour feedback helps us make Pitch better for teams like yours. Daily releases make it possible to collect more feedback faster. Now, bug fixes and UX improvements can be shipped as soon as they’re ready, instead of waiting until next week’s release. As part of this change, we’re introducing a robust feature-flagging system to improve our approach to testing and rolling out new features. Essentially, that means we can enable or disable new features in production without deploying code. \n\nPreviously, the way we managed betas was quite manual, making it difficult to test new features with more than a few thousand users at a time. With feature flagging, we have more flexibility in how we test and introduce updates, ensuring that new features are useful, delightful, and bug-free before we release them to everyone. It also means that we can get feedback that’s more representative of our customer base and that you and your team will have more opportunities to shape the future of Pitch.\n\n## Keep track of what’s new in Pitch\n\nMoving to daily releases allows us to iterate on how we deliver important product updates. Our weekly [release notes](https://pitch.com/whats-new) have been an essential and long-standing company ritual. Since our limited preview release kicked off in 2019, we’ve delivered 134 decks outlining the latest updates. \n\nStarting in July, we’ll move to monthly release notes that give a broader overview of the latest changes. We hope this helps you and your team stay on top of the latest changes without disrupting your flow while in Pitch. Of course, when we release significant updates and new features, we’ll make sure to highlight them, but more subtly. \n\nWe’ll also highlight updates, tips and tricks, and upcoming betas more frequently in our Slack Community, where some of our most passionate power users gather. If you’d like to be part of the ongoing conversation and connect directly with our product team, I encourage you to [join the community](https://pitch.com/community).\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch"],"title":"Every Week","visible-title":"\u0026#x1F44F; Every \u0026#x1F44F; Week \u0026#x1F44F;","date":"2021-08-19T09:33:46.896Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Adam Renklint","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628782790/blog/Header_MOBILE_Tech_Vision_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628782788/blog/Header_SMALL_Tech_Vision_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628782787/blog/Header_MID_Tech_Vision_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628782790/blog/Header_BIG_Q2_Tech_Vision_w1920.png","image-description":"Why Pitch ships every week","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628698573/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Tech_Vision.png","thumbnail-description":"Why Pitch ships every week","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628698573/blog/Social_share_Tech_Vision.png","meta-image-description":"Why Pitch ships every week","teaser-text":"At Pitch, we ship new features every single week for a reason.

Our technical choices and iterative approach to development let us maintain this pace, but it’s not just a strategy for our product. It’s the rhythm that drives our whole company in our mission to enable every team’s best thinking.\n\nWhen our founding team got together to discuss starting Pitch in 2018, we were all clear on one thing: We wanted a fresh start. \n\nWe’d all been teammates at Wunderlist, but after we were acquired, our paths had diverged. Some of us took roles at other tech companies, while others followed creative pursuits. \n\nWhat brought us back together was the shared feeling that work wasn’t feeling right. Together, we dreamed of starting a new team, with a new set of values that represented who we are and how we like to work together. \n\nFor me, as our technical leader, that meant one clear priority: to build a product team that constantly shipped exciting new features and improvements. Every. Single. Week.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1628689189/blog/1_TechVision_WeeklyReleaseView.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628689190/blog/1_TechVision_WeeklyReleaseView_w800.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nToday, that’s still my top priority, and for good reason. At Pitch, shipping every week isn’t just a strategy for our product — it’s the rhythm that drives our whole company. \n\nI want to take the opportunity to explain the technical foundation that lets us set this pace, the decision-making approach that ensures we can keep it up, and the real reason why it’s such a valuable advantage for us at Pitch.\n\n## A foundation for curiosity\n\nAs our founding CTO, two of the earliest choices I made were selecting Clojure as our primary programming language and the web as our primary application delivery platform. Each offers us distinct advantages, but they were made in the same spirit: to make room for curiosity and creativity among our engineering team.\n\nAs a functional programming language, Clojure removes a lot of the ceremony typically required as part of the development process. By putting the spotlight on data structures and pure functions, Clojure allows programmers to focus on the problem. Also, compared with traditional programming methods, Clojure enables a more dynamic feedback model and a more interactive experience for developers. \n\nIn simple terms, Clojure lets us get the tedious stuff out of the way, and gives our team the time, confidence and headspace for iteration. \n\nIn order to iterate, we use the REPL, or read-eval-print loop, as our main driver during development at Pitch. The basic premise of the REPL is that you change the running program in small ways and observe the results. \n\nWhen we’re building new features at Pitch, the REPL lets us start with small tasks and gradually automate them until we’ve reached the functionality we want. When we’re debugging, the REPL lets us quickly flag problems, inspect relevant data structures and develop fixes.\n\nThat brings us to our choice of the web as our application delivery platform. In a nutshell, the web is unrivaled in its reach and adaptability. The web browser’s capabilities give us the power to create an application that can be used anywhere that websites can be viewed or loaded, and our embrace of standard browser technology gives us the flexibility to integrate any kind of web content into Pitch. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628689190/blog/2_TechVision_Vision2_w1200.png] [alt:Pitch integrates with all content types and browsers] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSo, rather than spending our time reinventing wheels, we play to the strengths of the web platform (sharing via URLs, embedding website content, and making presentations fully interactive) and rely on decades of excellent progress in the area of optimized rendering engines.\n\nSure, these disparate benefits all sound great by themselves, but let me bring it back to why we really made these choices. It’s all about the culture they enable, in which every engineer at Pitch is empowered to be a product-minded team player. \n\nAs a team, we don’t spend our time talking about the accidental complexity of various native platforms — we talk about our users’ real-world needs and problems.\n\n## A journey of discovery\n\nWith the foundations of our engineering culture in place, my focus more recently has turned toward empowering our team to go on what I call a journey of discovery.\n\nTo do so, you need the right mindset. In our view, that means always seeking a balance between our gut intuition and our users’ feedback. If we’re biased too strongly toward the former, we’ll build a product with only ourselves in mind; if we’re biased too much toward the latter, we’ll overlook opportunities to add our own unique touch.\n\nIt’s not an easy balance to strike, but I can say with confidence that it’s our founding team’s superpower. We’ve spent a decade fine-tuning it — first at Wunderlist, and now at Pitch.\n\nIn my experience, finding this balance requires two conditions. \n\n* **First, we set and maintain a clear focus on the problem statement.** We expect team members to pause, get up, and think deeply about the problem they’re solving before any lines of code get written. \n* **Then, we create space for invention and experimentation.** Here we find that Clojure's dynamic, feedback-driven development style serves us as an inspiration in our product iteration engine as well.\n\nOur process for feature testing and evaluation is a good example of these conditions at work. Early on, we realized that the best way to see if we were on the right track with a new feature was to make a full build of the app available to the entire team. Not only did this simplify quality assurance; it also gave us a feel for how the change works in practice. In this spirit, we give developers the ability to share branch builds, work-in-progress versions of the product, as early as possible so we can collect feedback internally.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628689190/blog/3_TechVision_Vision3_w800.png] [alt:An example process for testing a new feature or improvement] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTo make branch builds and similar tools a reality, we rely on the unparalleled openness and flexibility of the web platform, where a look under the hood is often just a few clicks away. Taking a cue from the browser's built-in developer tools, our iteration engine is a suite of tools that allow us to focus on the essential complexity — on the user value.\n\n## A rhythm for our culture\n\nWith Clojure and the web as our tools, and the journey of discovery as our guiding approach, we’ve set up the conditions to ship fast. We can move fast without breaking things, and we can synthesize our users’ feedback and our own creativity into new features and improvements. Every week.\n\nBut let’s be clear on the intention behind our shipping pace. If we pursued this approach in an environment where chaos reigned, and in which we forced ourselves to stick to a shipping schedule “just because,” we’d burn people out and lose our natural curiosity and sense of fun. \n\nAnd to lose that, just for the sake of being able to say we ship fast, is not a tradeoff worth making.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nInstead, at Pitch, it’s about energizing ourselves with a shared rhythm of work.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMy co-founder Christian likes to say that our weekly shipping pace is like “a train leaving the station.” As an engineer at Pitch, you can catch this week’s train, or you can catch the next one, but the train is leaving on time either way. Every single week.\n\nIt’s the rhythm that lies at the core of our entire company. It gives us a shared pace; it helps us develop Pitch in true collaboration with our non-technical colleagues; and most importantly, it makes work fun.\n\n## Where our train is headed\n\nWe’ve got big plans for Pitch. As we [previewed earlier this year](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-series-b-funding), our vision extends far beyond building a better way to create slides. We’re building the first complete platform for presentations.\n\nFrom evolving the core editor experience to be even richer and more collaborative, to building in brand new functionality around analytics, sharing and playback, and creating a first-of-its-kind public ecosystem for publishing and exchanging presentations and templates, we’re going to have to wrangle significant product and technical complexity to succeed.\n\nTo do it, we’ll lean on the strength and reliability of Clojure and the power of the web platform, and we’ll leverage modern browser APIs that have turned the web from a hypertext viewer to the world’s foremost application distribution platform.\n\nBut to do it well, and to have fun doing it, we’ll be relying even more heavily on following our rhythm: breaking down our Herculean technical challenge into fun, stimulating problems, solving them with passion and creativity, and delivering fresh delight to our users. \n\nEvery 👏 single 👏 week.\n\n*Pitch is hiring at all levels.

Yet too often, they found themselves wasting time trying to find the right version of a deck in Keynote, instead of investing time perfecting their core messages. Pitch made “merge hell” and collaboration chaos a thing of the past, freeing them up to focus on getting the right messages in the hands of their sales team.\n\nFeedly is an AI-powered research tool that creates personalized feeds focused on the specific sources, topics, and trends a user is interested in. The self-funded (and profitable!) startup is used by 15 million individuals and 2,000 organizations around the world for everything from personal content curation and tech scouting to business intelligence and cybersecurity threat monitoring. One of the reasons the Feedly team has seen so much success is its dedication to really listening to customers, and then quickly implementing their feedback. \n\nJust one example of this is their iterative approach to product messaging. They continuously edit their sales decks as they get feedback from colleagues, customers, and prospects. Depending on what they hear in the market, the Feedly team will tailor content to reflect the words customers use when describing their goals and pain points.\n\nFeedly’s responsive approach has paid dividends in winning users’ trust, but cumbersome software has made it tough for the team behind the scenes (and the slides) to keep up. Tracking down the right version of a Keynote file in Google Drive was confusing, and small change ended up feeling like a big challenge. As their sales team grew, making sure their slides had the latest messaging iterations got harder and harder, and they were quickly heading toward a breaking point. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/1_Big_image_Feedly_1_w1200.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## “Merge hell” and versioning chaos \n\nFeedly’s sales team heavily relied on decks to sell their enterprise and vertical solutions. Many people had a hand in creating these decks, but almost all of them involved the help of Feedly’s founder and CEO Edwin Khodabakchian, product manager Olivia Malterre, and copywriter Annie Bacher. Together, they worked with the design team to continuously improve on messaging and get new decks into the hands of the sales team. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/2_Small_image_w800_FeedlyPitch_-2_1.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHistorically, Feedly used Keynote, but the process was starting to break down. \n\n\"We were using Keynote for presentations, which was more of a solitary experience,” Edwin says. “I would create the slides and send them around, then people would annotate a few things here and there and send it back to me.”\n\n“As we started to build out our team, we realized we wanted to work more collaboratively. I saw people naturally getting pulled into Google Slides, but it didn't have the control we needed to create really nice experiences. It was collaborative, but it was not nice.\" \n\nThe team found itself juggling versions and dealing with a time-consuming workflow. \n\n\"It was really tough to jump in and provide copy feedback when we were figuring out how to communicate a feature,” Annie says. “We were saving files in different places and naming them different versions. It was pretty confusing.\" \n\nEach version of a sales deck was stored on Google Drive as Keynote and PDF files. Any time a change was made, the team would need to download it, make the edits, update the file name with the latest version, and then upload it all back to Google Drive. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"Any time we would learn something new about our customers, we would have to switch to a new version. Even if it was just a matter of changing one slide,\" Olivia says. “It was just a nightmare. Saving so many versions and uploading them to Google Drive pushed the limits of my patience.”] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEven once they managed to track down the right version, it wasn't always immediately clear what changes had been made. \n\n\"It was super hard to see the differences between versions,\" Olivia says. At one point, they had to create a color coding system. Comments were left in the file as red text boxes, and each file was renamed with the editor's name. \n\nOnce the deck was ready, that wasn’t the end of it. Sales often didn’t have a clear way to understand which deck they should be using, leading to more stress and confusion. \n\n\"Anytime we would change something, we would have to tag them on Slack and say, ‘Hey, watch out, we have this new version to use. The other one is obsolete.’ And I was always scared that they would use the previous one.\" \n\n## Taking Pitch for a test drive \n\nThe team knew it needed a new way of doing things. “Every time we would go through this painful Keynote process, Edwin would say, ‘Pitch is coming! The beta is out soon,’” Annie remembers. \n\nWhen Pitch became available, Edwin took the lead on the team’s transition. He built the first deck and asked the design team to review the style and add core brand illustrations to their decks. \n\n“It was important that they could make sure that their slides were aligned with the Feedly brand and the in-app experience,” he explains. “Thanks to Pitch, we were able to create branded slides that felt like a more integral part of the experience we offer to users.\" \n\n## Collaboration beyond comments\n\nBefore, decks would ping-pong between teams. Now, there was no sending files back and forth. Everyone could see what was happening right in Pitch. \n\nThe team also loved that collaboration went beyond just comments. People could own different slides (or assign them to others) as well as update on the status of specific slides without circulating multiple files. Or, as Edwin put it, “No more going through merge hell.”\n\n“The benefit of shared links was huge,” Olivia says. Any changes made by the Feedly team were reflected immediately, and their sales team now has an easier way to share decks with prospects, rather than emailing a large PDF attachment. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/3_Small_image_w800_-3.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Life after “Is this the latest version?”\n\nWith Pitch, teams save time by being able to work together in the same file instead of having to create and then merge duplicates. Now that working on decks together is possible, more people across the company can leave comments on or make changes to decks. Edwin likes to iterate on slides as he hears what customers are saying. With Pitch, sales teams and subject matter experts can add their comments directly to the decks. \n\n\"He could never do that before — it was too complicated,\" Olivia says. \"Now we can get six or seven points of view on the same deck. It used to be one to three people. We became much more collaborative because of Pitch.\"\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"It's not just the process of creating slides. We got to combine this ideation and brainstorming process inside Pitch.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNow the team’s process for slide creation is agile enough to match their quick feedback cycles. After getting the raw content into Pitch, Edwin brings in different stakeholders to make sure it's directionally correct. He then works with the sales team to align on messaging, share insights into the language customers use, and shape the demo based on what they've learned in the field. Annie jumps in to simplify the copy, and then they share the link with a broader audience internally, or potentially with beta customers to see what they think.\n\n## Building a better launch playbook \n\nFeedly was able to apply this process to other areas of their work as well, finding new ways to use decks across their business. One example is their launch playbook. Similar to Amazon's idea of \"[working backwards](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-uses-a-secret-process-for-launching-new-ideas-and-it-can-transform-way-you-work.html)\" from the press release, Feedly evaluates demand for new products and features by starting with how they would potentially pitch them to users.\n\nThey create a playbook that outlines the content they'll create — like blog posts and testimonials — to support the launch. By starting with the end in mind, Feedly is able to perfect their product messaging and sell the idea to customers before they officially begin work.\n\n\"The launch playbook sets the true north of what we want the key messages to be, what the sales demo should be, and what the benefits are. It's a bit like Amazon's approach of starting with the press release. We start with the pitch,” Edwin explains. \n\nTheir playbooks were too iterative for Keynote, forcing them to use Google Docs. With Pitch, they can take a more visual approach and turn launch playbooks into high-impact decks. \n\n“The slides help us make sure we're focusing on the most important content and get really aligned on the key messages,” Edwin says. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/d39aa472-8638-40de-8c3f-c41d84659546?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“It used to be difficult to distribute this information to sales. But as a medium, Pitch is perfect. People are busy, so having a short deck with a few key visuals and clear messaging lets them get an idea of what the feature will do.”\n\n## Working better, together\n\n\"If for some reason Pitch didn't exist and we had to go back to the old way, it would be a major pain,” Edwin says. “With Pitch, I don't have to compromise.” \n\nThey get the brand control that Keynote offers, with browser-based collaboration like Google Slides, all in one place. \n\n\"I feel so much more free,\" Olivia says. Not only does Pitch save the team time, but it's enabled them to improve and iterate on decks in a way that's much more natural. \n\nBy making it easy to involve more people, Feedly is able to arrive at the right messaging for the right market faster than before, and they have space to focus on more important topics beyond finding the right version of a deck.\n\n\"Now that we have Pitch we're able to expand the way we use presentations,” Edwin says. In addition to sales decks and launch playbooks, they're using Pitch for roadmap planning and internal documentation.\n\nFor the Feedly team, switching to Pitch meant more efficient processes, but it also meant more than that. Freed from asking where the latest version of the deck was located, the team grew stronger and more united and were finally able to focus on what really mattered: how to speak their customers’ language. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“It's more than just a slide-building tool.

Recently, it’s transcended the work sphere too — no longer just a topic in board and team meetings and on Twitter, it’s showing up at family dinners, on the front page of major newspapers, and in the halls of government. \n\nIn my own work as a product design lead at Pitch, this AI whirlwind has felt both incredibly exciting and overwhelmingly daunting. To help anyone else out there trying to see the forest for the trees, we’re sharing our [AI explorations deck](https://pitch.com/v/AI-Explorations-Public-i6nny7). It includes the process and frameworks we used to investigate the opportunities this technology presents, as well as the lessons learned and principles developed along the way. \n\nWe hope this will help other product teams, especially those in the generative AI space, deliver value faster.

Even large incumbents have a fire under them and are innovating like startups. Actual startups are fighting to be associated with the AI gold rush, desperate to avoid being left behind. But at the same time, we’re beholden to the rapidly changing functionality of a handful of central models — from OpenAI, Meta, and Midjourney to emerging open-source models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nAs a product leader, you face two opposing risks:\n\n1. Rush into shipping features that generate generic, uninspired output, and you’ll probably become irrelevant once every competitor implements the same feature(s).\n2. Deprioritize AI-powered features to focus on the rest of your roadmap, and it’s likely you’ll be left behind in the technological revolution.\n\nSo how do you strike the right balance? How can you stay sane surrounded by the noise about AI? Here are the three lessons we’ve learned, which we’re using as North Star principles as we explore this brave new world.\n\n## 1 . Generating vs. editing: The balance between human and machine\n\nAfter spending five years building a presentation tool, we’ve learned a lot about what makes presentations hard. The challenge is not the initial outline or the basic information included, but designing and delivering engaging slides that speak to an audience. That involves collaborating with your team and magically combining things like text, images, layouts, and voiceover to create a smooth delivery experience. It’s a lot more complex than even Pitch’s founders initially thought. Similarly, whatever space you’re working in, it’s a safe bet you have more institutional knowledge about the problems your product addresses than anyone besides your direct competitors. \n\nIn our explorations, what we saw very quickly is that AI can help you with parts of the intricate presentation-building process, but that it’s not (yet) sophisticated enough to take over presentation-generation entirely. We’re confident that AI plus a human editor will remain more powerful than AI alone — at least in the shorter term — because of the complexity of the presentation medium. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“AI can help with parts of the intricate presentation-building process, but it’s not sophisticated enough to take over entirely.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThat’s not to say there aren’t areas of our space where AI can be very effective. In fact, even before the current AI boom, there were smaller automated features within Pitch, like [AI-powered image cropping](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748894-edit-and-crop-images). \n\nSo ask yourself this: What do you know about the biggest challenges in your space? What elements are straightforward? How is combining them hard? Where can AI enable, and where is human intervention still needed — and likely to be needed for a while? Agree on the answers to these questions as a product team, have confidence in your point of view, and use these answers as the starting point for your strategy.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/5b5f10c8-c85d-4fac-9f1e-7774249416f7/1b11321d-6129-4abc-a6df-dafa65bd6c35\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 2. Keeping up with the Joneses: The importance of timing\n\nThe question every product manager is asking themselves right now is obvious: How do we ship the right AI-powered features fast? Your marketing team’s probably asking you this as they try to jump on the AI-related news cycle, and your customers are likely starting to wonder too. But there are diminishing returns in pumping short-term leads or signups with AI hype — you could lose those users a month later with a subpar product.\n\nAnd your challenge goes deeper than the usual pressure to ship standout features fast. The large language models (LLMs) you rely on to deliver these features are rapidly evolving, so you’ll need to factor in external dependencies, over which you probably have no control. Many AI features, like text-rewriting, are becoming as commonplace as bold or italic font options. Image generation will soon become so standard that it’ll no longer be any different than searching the web for images. These types of features should be considered table stakes, not differentiators.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Instead of asking, ‘How fast can we ship?’ your core question should be, ‘How can we add AI in a way that’s differentiated, offers high value, and speaks to our specific audience?’”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nInstead of asking, “How fast can we ship?” your core question should be, “How can we add AI in a way that’s differentiated, offers high value, and speaks to our specific audience?” Otherwise you’re chasing too many opportunity areas, and trying to keep up with too many developments beyond your control.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: Avoid copying features others are building without careful reflection, and don’t prioritize speed over strategy. Instead, filter all your development options for AI products and features based on 1) Uniqueness and defensibility, 2) Value to your target audience, and 3) Current and near-future expectations of your target audience. If you rank all your options based on a mix of these factors, it will guide prioritization and help you focus.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/5b5f10c8-c85d-4fac-9f1e-7774249416f7/ef55fafd-752a-4943-ad96-95c4cd35a1d0\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 3. It’s a marathon, not a sprint: AI success depends on fundamentals\n\nSome companies are better positioned to ride the AI wave. Advantages include having a modern web stack, access to large amounts of data that assist LLMs, and a nimble, highly adaptable team. It’s time to ask yourself what your organizational advantages are when it comes to AI. That said, adding value in the age of AI still involves good product fundamentals. Teams need to stick to design sprints, follow clear roadmaps, and rigorously prioritize which problems to solve. \n\nThere are also AI-specific considerations. To build long-term, differentiated value in your space through AI, you’ll need access to data to train your own AI models. What data do you have that others don’t? Where is the data? Is it usable? Answering these questions is key.\n\nTeam structure can help balance some of the opportunities and distractions that AI offers. At Pitch, we’ve created a dedicated “moonshot” team who can focus on incubating solutions to the biggest, thorniest presentation problems using AI — without distracting the teams delivering the majority of our roadmap.\n\nUltimately, you need to think hard about whether you’re putting measures in place to succeed in this new context. Product fundamentals didn’t go away the day ChatGPT came to town. But you may need to restructure or rethink processes, data structures, and team organization to balance risks, rewards, and focus.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/5b5f10c8-c85d-4fac-9f1e-7774249416f7/7ee22233-a5ad-4c3b-b612-d36c9edcdf16\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Where these lessons have led us\n\nOne thing we’ve always been sure of is that the world doesn’t need more mediocre presentations. There’s a real danger in focusing on the wrong AI opportunities, because it could result in exactly that. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“The world doesn’t need more mediocre presentations.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOur product team works in six-week cycles, so we ran a hackathon within one cycle to understand our AI opportunities, research the tech, and prioritize work based on all the criteria outlined in the lessons above. We then had a single product team explore these in more depth — you can discover the output of our explorations in [this deck](https://pitch.com/v/AI-Explorations-Public-i6nny7). \n\nNow, we’re pursuing two parallel AI paths:\n\n1. **Commoditized AI APIs as a feature development tool.** We’ll continue to consider publicly available APIs as tools to enable feature development. We won’t search for problems just to be able to use a specific technology; instead, we’ll apply the technology, if appropriate, when solving the problems our current and future users care about.\n2. **Foundational AI models as a differentiator.** Instead of passively awaiting new models alongside competitors, we’ll lead the way in collaborating with infrastructure providers and model makers. We’ll combine our domain knowledge with their technical expertise, and solve the biggest challenges involved in building great decks. This will create new opportunities for differentiated and defensible features.\n\nHave any thoughts about [our explorations](https://pitch.com/v/AI-Explorations-Public-i6nny7), or any opinions about what would work best for Pitch users?

In every competition, I always used the keyboard and mouse in combination. In fact, in most competitive games — like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Starcraft — this is the standard.\n\nIn video games, you’re using the keyboard and mouse for different things, but they both have their value: The keyboard has a lot of keys so you can trigger a lot of actions, and the mouse is the most precise device. This is true whether you’re pointing at enemies or dragging rectangles in a presentation.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_1.jpg] [alt:Jeremy Vuillernet Counter-strike champion Pitch ] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe quick menu, which is also called the command palette, command center, or even the Command+K menu, is a menu where users can type to search for various actions to do in an app. It has gained a lot of traction recently thanks to tools like Superhuman, Slack, and Linear, who brought powerful shortcuts with keyboard-first interactions to the masses.\n\nOne of the things we’re starting to see is that for many people — including us at Pitch — the quick menu has become almost synonymous with keyboard shortcuts. Don’t believe me? Almost everything you read about quick menus will contain a section about shortcuts. Take [this episode of Intercom on Product](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-on-product-ep05): The title of the talk is keyboard-first, and the first question is about the quick menu.\n\n## **Quick menu ≠ keyboard shortcuts**\n\nIt makes sense that we associate them with one another, as they play well together. The quick menu is keyboard friendly, and it’s also a very good place to show and teach shortcuts. The problem with tying them together is that we miss opportunities by only focusing on the keyboard.\n\nThey don’t rely on each other, let alone achieve the same function. An app can have a powerful quick menu without any shortcuts. Inversely, an app can have a lot of powerful shortcuts without any quick menu. The Intercom podcast discusses the rising trend of command-line interfaces that have born a new breed of productivity apps, ones that offer “shortcuts to superpowers.”\n\nIt’s true that keyboard shortcuts and the quick menu fall into the same productivity-helper category: Both of them are designed to help you achieve your action quicker. The quick menu makes it faster to find an action; the shortcut makes it faster to execute an action.\n\n## **Introducing Pitch’s quick menu**\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_7_tilbp3.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_quickmenu.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAt Pitch, my team’s goal is to find new ways to make it faster to create better presentations, and one area we felt had potential was the quick menu. Presentation tools serve many different functions, and to keep our user interface simple and attractive, we can't show every single option on the screen. The quick menu would give us the ability to bring all of the features together in an efficient and searchable interface, so users could quickly access actions like changing the status of a slide or inserting an element like a text box. \n\nIn the beginning of designing Pitch’s quick menu, we were focused entirely on the keyboard. So much so, that in some ways, I felt we were falling into the trap of building a “[Superhuman of X](https://uxdesign.cc/so-youre-building-a-superhuman-of-x-b39015f3d7a6).”\n\nWe took a step back and started by asking what our users needed. When we did, we found that different tools have very different needs. On one hand, you have modern, collaborative productivity tools like Slack, Superhuman, and Linear, and on the other, you have design tools like Figma, Sketch, and Canva. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nPitch sits at the intersection between these two worlds — and that’s where our magic is — so we built a CMD-K interface that played into both strengths.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTools like Superhuman and Slack are typing-focused: When you're writing emails, notes, or messages, to be efficient you usually need both hands on the keyboard and there's minimal mouse interaction. This is not true for most design tools.\n\nFor Figma, Photoshop, or even Pitch, the mouse is a powerful tool. When creating a presentation in Pitch, you are mostly interacting with a slide, or what we sometimes call the canvas. Similar to design tools, the canvas allows you to add, move, resize and rotate objects by directly manipulating them. The precision of the mouse (or any pointing device) makes it a far better companion than the keyboard for these sort of actions.\n\nEarly on, as we were prototyping Pitch’s quick menu, we saw users were using their mouse to interact with it. It made sense, since you regularly need to put your hands back on the mouse after triggering an action such as adding an element to your slide. \n\n## **Making a mouse-friendly quick menu**\n\nAfter understanding why the mouse was important, we began to think about how we could embrace the way our users were interacting with the keyboard and mouse to unlock additional value. Ultimately we invented a few new concepts on top of what currently exists. The two most significant were single-letter shortcuts and submenus.\n\n### **Single-letter shortcuts that can be used with your mouse**\n\nTo go back to video games, you don’t find a lot of shortcuts that require modifiers like Command and Shift. The reason is simple: More keys make it harder to type, requiring more effort and attention to get right. We use single-letter shortcuts like “S” or “J,” instead of Command+J, Command+O or even complex shortcuts like Command+Shift.\n\nWe were also thinking about prioritizing single-letter shortcuts on the left of the keyboard. Those are easier to use and closer to the natural position of the hand. As an exercise, with one hand on the mouse and one hand on the keyboard, try to hit the “I” key without looking at the keyboard. Now do the same with “S.” Which one are you more confident hitting?\n\nHave you ever wondered why the most popular shortcuts don’t start with the letter of the word?\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_2.jpg] [alt:popular keyboard shortcuts] [caption:Instead, we have Z for undo and X to cut.] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe reason is that these shortcuts were chosen due to location, not based on spelling. The position is actually more important than the word themselves. All these little details we take for granted were actually designed a long time ago so we can be efficient with one hand on the keyboard and one hand on the mouse.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_8.png] [alt:] [caption:Single-letter shortcuts mean you don't have to play Twister with your fingers to trigger a shortcut.] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### **Submenus to help build habits**\n\nSubmenus offer filtered lists to give you the most relevant options for whatever you’re doing at that moment. So, for example, let’s say you press S, you will then see a submenu with all of our available shapes.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_6_dkdqv3.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_shape.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe benefit of this is you don’t have to search, and you can directly access what’s most relevant to what you’re working on in that moment. In a way, this is similar to a context menu (also called a right-click menu) as it narrows down the list of possible actions to the ones that are specific to the current selection. For submenus with more items, we can still show the search input but we move the most common actions to the top which makes it easy to reach with the mouse.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_4_iumvel.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_assign_sktp6p.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWithout the submenu, you could only use one shortcut per key, and we would run out of keys to use pretty quickly. But with the submenu, you can reuse the same keys at different times. For example, when pressing A, we open the assignment submenu. We can later reuse A for “arrow” when inside the Shape submenu. With more possible combinations, features don’t have to fight for the best shortcut.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/jeremy_post_5.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**The best part? You don’t need to learn shortcuts**\n\nThe amazing thing here isn’t just the seamless way that the keyboard and mouse complement one another, it’s that these moments are also educational for users. Users learn iteratively. It starts with using the quick menu, then the submenu, and then the shortcuts. Most of the time, users do this without even consciously feeling like they are learning at all.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nThis is really significant because it offers accessibility to people who may be intimidated by learning all the shortcuts.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you find yourself adding a lot of rectangles, you’ll likely find that you begin using the S ⇒ R combination without even realizing it. Of course, you can still directly type \"rectangle\" and get a rectangle, but many users just naturally begin to use the combination.\n\nOur quick menu wasn’t built for power users only; it’s meant to make every type of user feel like a power user. Pitch’s quick menu offers the ability to choose. If you aren’t a shortcut person, it’s okay! You don’t need to memorize everything, and shortcuts are easy to discover, even if you never plan to press Command+K. By building for both types of users, Pitch makes it even faster for teams to collaborate on presentations.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe bottom line? Just because something is on-trend doesn’t mean it will work for every type of app. It’s important to consider the context of your product and your users’ existing expectations. That's why we front-load user research — speaking with users, observing their existing behavior, and eventually sharing prototypes of our work — and spend time closely analyzing the data once something ships. We want Pitch to be a wow-worthy experience for presentation novices and pros, so we take our time to nail the details. It's still early days for the quick menu, and there's a lot more fine-tuning to do, but we're already seeing the fruits of our labor.

Enabling teams is the core of our mission at Pitch, so we conducted a survey to help managers and team members find ways to thrive over the next year.\n\nWe polled 2,000 digital workers in the US and UK to uncover how they're coping, their expectations for the year ahead, and what sets thriving teams apart. We’ve published our findings as the [Thriving Teams Report](https://pitch.com/presentations/Thriving-Teams-Report-6MeYdL231FW556YUSv3soMw7) in our new [presentation gallery](https://pitch.com/presentations). Highlights below.\n\n## Work’s new normal isn’t so bad\n\nOur survey asked respondents to paint a picture of what work is like for them, and to assess how things had changed since the start of the pandemic. We were surprised by what we uncovered:\n\n1. Teamwork and communication are the strongest aspects of work right now.\n2. Most aspects of work haven't gotten better or worse since the pandemic started.\n3. Workers were over three times as likely to report positive changes (vs. negative ones).\n\nWork is now more flexible than ever — particularly for remote and hybrid workers. They told us they’d gained the most freedom in their workplace location, their interactions with family and friends, and their workspace setup. \n\nThere are many reasons for optimism: More than four in five workers told us they have a clear understanding of their roles, feel strongly connected to their teammates, and feel free to express themselves with teammates and leadership. For leaders worried about declining engagement, that’s cause for a sigh of relief.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639133386/blog/1_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Room for more freedom and support\n\nHowever, many digital workers still say they’re missing key freedoms. Only half of respondents said they can choose their software, and only slightly more (60%) said they have control over the meetings they attend. \n\nThere also wasn’t much consensus about whether workers’ growth mattered to leadership: 33% of respondents told us their employer didn’t care about the trajectory of their career.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639133386/blog/2_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe silver lining here is that the pandemic hasn’t worsened these aspects of work, so they remain within leaders’ control to improve. There was just one aspect of work that more workers said had gotten worse (vs. gotten better): opportunities to socialize and bond with their colleagues. \n\n### Gaps between leaders, teams and genders\n\nOur survey showed considerable diversity within digital workers’ feelings toward their jobs. One of the most notable differences we found was between leaders and team members: Leaders feel more empowered than their teams. \n\nFrom choice over tools, meetings, and location, to the support they feel from their employer to grow and take risks, respondents with the title of Director or above were 30-70% more likely to rate aspects of their work experience positively than those with less senior titles.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639133386/blog/3_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWorkers’ experiences also differed by gender, with men being 20-30% more likely than women to report that they feel supported, able to take risks, and able to bond and express themselves. Socializing and strengthening team bonds represented the biggest gender-based difference: only 52% of women said they could do so, compared with nearly 69% of men. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639133386/blog/4_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFor leaders seeking to engage their teams in the year ahead, the message is clear: Focus on making everyone’s work experience more free and equal.\n\n## What digital workers want next year\n\nIn the final part of our survey, we asked workers to rate their priorities at a personal, team and company level as they related to a successful 2022 at work. Here’s what we found:\n\n1. Better control over schedule and reachability is the highest personal priority.\n2. Workers care about preserving the strength of their team communication.\n3. Workers want to know their employer will keep caring for their health and well-being.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639151148/blog/5_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTaken together, workers’ 2022 priorities reflect the persistent pressure and uncertainty of COVID. They want control over their workdays that better aligns with their more remote, asynchronous reality, they want to preserve the strength and health of their teams, and they want assurances that their employer will be there for them as the world navigates its way out of the pandemic.\n\n## What sets thriving teams apart\n\nOne of the main goals of our survey was to explore the drivers behind teams that are thriving. To do that, we first had to create a definition. We went about this by looking at the subset of respondents who answered positively to all 23 questions about engagement at work, and then comparing them against the corresponding group that didn’t. \n\nWe found that thriving workers are much more likely to be able to choose their tools, develop leadership skills, and have opportunities to bond with their colleagues.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639133386/blog/6_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThriving workers are much more likely to feel support from their employer in growing and taking risks, and they’re more likely to have faith in the leadership team.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1639151245/blog/7_HeroDeck__w800.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSome aspects of work weren’t at all correlated with thriving. Most notably, we found that the office isn't a make-or-break factor for thriving at work. Our respondents were just as likely to thrive in remote, hybrid and in-person setups. None had a clear advantage.\n\nFor leaders who have been reading the headlines about the Great Resignation, that should come as welcome news, but it’s not an opportunity to invite everyone back to the office. Workers clearly have strong preferences toward where they work, as [survey after survey](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/384622) has already shown, and future changes in workplace policy should always be carefully considered.\n\n## New Year's resolutions for leaders\n\n* 🛠 Help your teams address lack of choice, freedom and equality at work.\n* ⚕️ Focus your attention on your teams' health and growth.\n* 🚀 Create space for your teams to take risks, and invest in their development.\n* 💼 Your office policy isn’t a solution for driving engagement.\n\nCheck out the full Thriving Teams Report below for more detailed insights, and if you’re a leader with a story to tell around how you helped your team thrive, or you’d like to learn more around how Pitch can enable your team’s best thinking, [get in touch with us](https://twitter.com/Pitch) on Twitter.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/d390d902-d2e8-4f70-ae76-4617c385f9ef\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How 4 teams create winning sales presentations","date":"2021-06-14T09:24:11.469Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Aimee Millwood","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_Header_MOBILE__w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_Header_SMALL__w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_Header_MID__w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_1600x1200.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_Cover_thumbnail_420x300.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/salesdeck_Social_share.png","teaser-text":"We asked four sales teams from modern companies about their workflow.

And the last place you should be wasting your time is creating your presentation. In this post, we’ll hear from sales teams at four different companies and learn how they use Pitch in their day-to-day workflows to make the process of building sales presentations more efficient, and even enjoyable.\n\nAs a salesperson, you’re likely familiar with the scrambling and searching that comes when you set out to build a sales presentation. You need the right slides and you need them fast. But where are they? And who has the latest version of the brand guidelines? Where do you even start?\n\nAnd even after getting started, the process doesn’t get easier. Collecting feedback from other stakeholders and getting to a final draft is a pain. Once you’re ready to present, you’ve got to figure out the best way to share your deck with clients in a way that’s easy for them to digest and understand.\n\n## Stop getting stuck searching for the right slides\n\nPaul Thümer, the Head of Sales at \u003ca href=\"https://www.framen.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFramen\u003c/a\u003e, readily admits he isn’t a presentation builder. He likes to use presentations in his day-to-day work, but the idea of actually building them himself is exhausting. He still remembers what life was like before the Framen team started using Pitch. \n\n“Everybody used different tools. It was really chaotic,” Paul says. “It was hard to collaborate from different locations together. Downloading and sending files was tedious.” \n\nDominik Wittenbrink, who leads the sales team at \u003ca href=\"https://alteos.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlteos\u003c/a\u003e, can relate. His team faces the added challenge of selling B2B2C. Instead of selling directly to customers, they sell via partners, which means there are tons of possible starting points, and salespeople are often confused where to begin. \n\n“Our PowerPoint slides were everywhere. Somebody moved something and you found nothing,” Dominik says. \nThis is a common problem for many teams: It’s hard to find the latest version of slides, especially when they’re spread across different folders and tools. In Pitch, all of a team’s presentations are centralized inside of workspaces and organized in folders. \n\nSince Dominik’s team switched to Pitch, all their decks are in one place and easy for everyone on the team to locate. “We finally have a single, centralized presentation version that we can easily duplicate to adjust content,” he adds.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“We finally have a single, centralized presentation version that we can easily duplicate and adjust content.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Create customized decks that are on brand every time\n\nAnother challenge is the need to create custom decks for each prospect while still ensuring they stick to your company’s style guide. Who has time to fiddle with fonts and colors when you need to get a sales presentation ready and you’re scrambling for time?\n\nPeter Krämer, Marketing Designer from Alteos, shares how he uses [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) and styles in Pitch to make sure their sales presentations are on brand, every time.\n\n“Using our newest branding I created one sales presentation in Pitch that we could adapt for different use cases,” he says. “Then, I made one for every product we offer using the same styles. Now every sales rep has their own folder, and if they want to add a new slide, they know where to find it.”\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a6d02d7a-eef9-4f6e-be07-305d2e2a02f6?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFramen also appreciates the option to easily duplicate and customize presentations. They created all of their workspace templates in English and German and regularly update all of the templates whenever their sales team needs a new slide layout. All sales managers then use the provided templates and customize the content to their needs.\n\n“Before, when we were using PowerPoint or Google Slides, we were making generic presentations,” Paul says. “Generally, if you tailor each presentation to a client’s brand and business, negotiation goes better and you win more business. Thanks to Pitch, we can use templates to ensure all of our presentations look alike, while customizing them to each client.”\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9defd6fb-d09f-4688-931c-82c7f6a1cf9a?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAmon Ghaiumy is a co-founder of \u003ca href=\"https://ophelos.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOphelos\u003c/a\u003e. Like Alteos and Framen, their startup’s 25-slide sales deck template is styled according to their brand guidelines, and then the content is continuously updated by Amon and his fellow co-founder.\n\nThey work to ensure their templates are kept up-to-date so they contain the most relevant information. For example, whenever they see a slide appearing in other presentations more than three times, they add it to one of the templates.\n\n“We enjoy collaborating with comments, slide assignments, and statuses to improve the template together,” he says.\n\n## Meet clients where they are with flexible sharing options\n\nAfter a sales presentation is ready, the time comes to share it with the world (or, at least potential clients). But every company and team has a different workflow and preferred way of receiving presentations, which means precious time is wasted just trying to get a sales presentation in the hands of prospects.\n\n### Send a good ol’ PDF\n\nSome customers are not ready to explore new tools, and they prefer the traditional PDF. The team at \u003ca href=\"https://www.hive.app/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHive\u003c/a\u003e takes this workflow to the next level. Not only are they using Pitch to share and present [proposals to clients](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Proposal); they also seal the deal on slides. They add contractual slides with conditions and signatures to the client’s individual Pitch presentation and export it so the proposal becomes a binding legal document. Then, they send the PDF to clients to sign. \n\n### Share via email or link\n\nWhile PDFs are great in some cases, they are still static documents, and depending on the amount of images in your deck, they can become quite heavy. In order to keep documents lightweight while making sure all video and embedded visuals move as they should, sales teams that use Pitch are able to [share via link or email](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748926-share-a-presentation-with-others).\n\n### Present live with live video collaboration\n\nOther teams prefer to control the narrative and see how clients react as they walk them through slides in real time. At Framen, they often present their Pitch decks on a Zoom call. At Alteos, they meet customers in Pitch using live video collaboration. They invite customers to join in on sessions and make changes directly on the slide, together.\n\n## So, what's the bottom line?\n\nAs a sales person you probably measure impact through numbers. While it’s difficult to calculate the precise ROI of better presentation software, we asked these teams: How does Pitch impact your sales process or customer success? Here’s what they had to say:\n\n\u003e “We’re getting a lot of positive feedback on our sales presentations. Just today a CEO of one company said that the presentation looked intuitive and it flowed.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — Dominik from Alteos\n\u003e\n\u003e “Pitch is a good-looking, modern tool, which helps us present how we tackle the D2C logistics in a modern way. It helps us bring our mindset to our customers.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — Lukas from Hive\n\u003e\n\u003e “Without Pitch, we would spend a lot more time on presentations, and our decks would not look as good. So we definitely save a lot of valuable time in comparison to other tools.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — Amon from Ophelos\n\u003e\n\u003e “Having other stakeholders involved in Pitch helps us close more deals, especially because we are able to create a big number of customized presentations in a short time, which give us the competitive advantage to move faster and attend to more clients.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — Paul from Framen\n\nThere you have it: an inside look at how teams from four modern companies are driving more value and increasing sales wins using Pitch."},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How a savvy sales team primes itself for success","visible-title":"How a savvy sales team primes itself for success","date":"2023-04-27T06:38:42.027Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Ariane Phipps-Morgan","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335695/blog/Primer/Header_MOBILE_Primer_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335695/blog/Primer/Header_SMALL_Primer_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335694/blog/Primer/Header_MID_Primer_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335694/blog/Primer/Header_BIG_Primer_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335694/blog/Primer/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Primer.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1682335696/blog/Primer/Social_share_Primer.png","tweet-text":"","teaser-text":"Primer’s head of sales enablement might seem like a seasoned slide whiz, but it wasn’t always that way.

The payments automation platform has a straightforward mission: Be the simplest way for online businesses to build beautiful buying experiences for their customers. When it came to selling their product, they needed a tool that matched their values and the way they worked. \n\nPrimer’s fully remote company operates across the globe, catering to clients from travel to retail to online gaming. Chris Jacques, Head of Sales Enablement, works alongside a team of 10 salespeople, a BDR, and solutions engineers. The team is innovative, fast, and efficient — just the way they like it. \n\nThose same attributes are exactly what they like about Pitch, too.\n\n## “Please duplicate” — Scaling decks made simple\n\nFor Chris and the sales team, presentations are, literally, life. They use presentations internally for roadmaps, all-hands meetings, and training materials. And, of course, they use external-facing presentations to sell their product in every phase of the cycle.\n\nAt the heart of their sales motion is a client-centric deck template that outlines the problems in the market and how Primer solves them. It serves as the basic blueprint for pretty much every sales deck at Primer, including RFPs, commercial proposals, and technical overviews. Chris [built up the presentation](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3752837-create-a-template) in Pitch by drafting basic text slides, which he then annotated with comments for the design team. Once the designers had worked their magic, Chris [collaborated with them in real time](https://pitch.com/use-cases/presentation-maker) to make final tweaks. \n\nChris was surprised by how fast it came together. He’s not, in his own words, “a good slide mule.” He adds, “Personally, that’s something I love about Pitch. I’m not super technical, and it really makes me feel like I know what I’m doing.”\n\nHe wanted to empower his team to feel the same. At his previous company, people would get bogged down by the [Sisyphean process](https://pitch.com/pitch-vs-powerpoint) of building a customized presentation in PowerPoint: “Every slide would have a huge, ugly note about how to use and customize it. Getting a single slide ready for the presentation was like reading a novel. Sometimes people were going through 150, 170 slides just to find the 30 they needed for their presentation.”  \n\nThe core template Chris created lives online and is constantly evolving to include additions and improvements; it currently consists of around 50 slides. When a salesperson needs to hop on a call with a new prospect, they just duplicate the template — as the first slide instructs — and choose the slides they need to customize their story. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“With Pitch, you instantly seem super professional and put together. And off to the races you go.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“The sales deck template makes it easier for my team to do their job,” says Chris. “I mean, click duplicate, think about what you're trying to go through with your merchant, delete the slides you don't need — and boom, you're ready for a presentation in an hour. At my old company, that would take people literally a week to do. With Pitch, you instantly seem super professional and put together. And off to the races you go.”\n\n## Sealing the deal, from demo deck to detailed follow-up\n\nDuring a call, sales reps typically talk through the deck they’ve just pulled together from their approved sales template, and demo the product. But that’s just the start. \n\n“Our sale is inherently multistakeholder,” says Chris. “You’ll go into a meeting with 4 people, but then there are 20 other people that need something extra to understand the Primer solution. So we’re always being asked, ‘Can you send over something I can share internally?’” \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1682335696/blog/Primer/Slides_video_Primer_2.mp4] [poster:] [caption:A sales slide that’s shown during a call vs the more detailed version that’s sent as a follow-up] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTo accommodate these stakeholders, Chris’s team can easily iterate on their core deck to create more text-heavy, technical leave-behinds. Often, they’re paired with [video recordings](https://pitch.com/use-cases/video-presentation-maker), which make them more attractive than a typical one-pager. \n\nAll the different decks are cataloged into [private folders](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4456444-share-private-folders-with-others) in Pitch, where team members can collaborate in smaller, invite-only groups. These folders are then broken down by team, stage, region, and type. For instance, there’s “BD - Qualification,” “BD - EMEA,” and “BD - Weekly meeting.” That way, it's easy to pull up the decks for future reference. “If we've had a similar client or case before,” notes Chris, “We can say, ‘Hey go check out this presentation.’”\n\n## Little recordings, big returns\n\nAs an enablement person, Chris is very conscious of the way people absorb information, which is why he’s a big fan of Pitch’s native video recordings: “It’s really easy to integrate recordings into a Pitch deck, and that’s very powerful. In today’s TikTok world, having engaging video content on slides is nonnegotiable. Visual, quick hits are how people learn nowadays.”\n\nHis typical training process is to create a slide on a specific topic, record a video around that topic, and then check that people have understood it. When he built the core sales deck, for instance, he used recordings to educate his team on why each slide matters, how to present the slides live, and how to customize a deck. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“It’s really easy to integrate recordings into a Pitch deck, and that’s very powerful. In today’s TikTok world, having engaging video content on slides is nonnegotiable.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:] [spacingBottom:] [spacingSize:]}}\n\nWhenever a new product launches, he adds to his mini how-to series, cracking a joke before launching into a tried-and-true spiel: Here's something new, and here's what you need to be successful. Here's a slide. Here's a talking point. Here’s what merchants might ask, and here’s how to resolve it. Here's a stat of market relevance. Here's the documentation. “Some of my slides will just be a visual and my little face in the corner,” he says. “I’ll talk about it for 90 seconds, then move to the next topic.”\n\nCreating recordings can be super fast — a fact the sales team leveraged for their [Observability](https://primer.io/observability/) launch. The PM behind the new feature was able to quickly record an async product demo for their landing page to warm up leads before a call. “The result,” says Chris, “is epic.”\n\n## Turning ready-made templates into a brand identity\n\nIn Primer’s early days, Monika Ocieczek, Head of Product Design, “was making all of the team’s slides using a mashup of Keynote and Figma.” This was before they had a fully fledged brand identity, and way before Chris built up the core sales deck template. But obviously, she says, “Keynote only works on Macs.” For a growing, fully remote team with varying tech setups, that was an issue.\n\nInstead, she introduced the team to a new tool she’d recently discovered.\n\nEnter Pitch.\n\nPrimer’s sales team started using Pitch as a design hack to get the unified brand look they wanted — fast. Their secret? [Presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates). Salespeople with zero design experience could pick custom sales templates with similar colors to Primer, and quickly build decks that looked professional and on brand. \n\nThen once Chris and the design team came on board, they were able to double down on enablement. “The very first deck I ever redesigned,” remembers Yıldız Alidzhikova, a graphic designer at Primer, “already looked pretty good because the sales team had used a Pitch presentation template.” \n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1666593833/templates-grid/sales-pitch.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Pitch-57Koq538XwuU5VWRwV4GFcCm\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/async-sales-deck.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“Google Slides also has templates,” says Yıldız, “but the ones in Pitch are way cooler. They’re better design-wise, are more thoughtfully curated, and are honestly just more inspiring. When you're in the UI, everything looks and feels nice, and you have features like stickers that are fun to work with. It’s obvious that Pitch has put a lot of effort into enabling anyone to make really impressive presentations.” \n\nScaling sales teams want to focus on revenue growth, not processes — which is why Pitch is such a boon to Chris, and why it has found its way into other commercial teams’ workflows. “Before I started at Primer a year ago,” he says, “I’d never seen Pitch out in the wild. Now I see it everywhere: on Twitter, in articles I’m reading, when I receive a deck from another company. I'm like, ‘Oh, I recognize you. You’re Pitch.’”"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How a small design team supports growing needs","date":"2021-11-22T11:01:23.932Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Aimee Millwood","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319859/blog/Header_MOBILE_Patch_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319864/blog/Header_SMALL_Patch_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319862/blog/Header_MID_Patch_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319860/blog/Header_BIG_Patch_w1920.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319856/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Patch.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319863/blog/Social_share_Patch.jpg","teaser-text":"Learn how Patch used Pitch to improve sales productivity, stay in sync, and invest their small but mighty design team’s time where it matters most.

As they look to the next stage of growth for their business, scaling efficiently is top of mind. Using Pitch, they are able to improve sales productivity, stay in sync, and invest their small but mighty design team’s time where it matters most. \n\nAs anyone who has worked in a startup knows, you often need to wear many different hats in the early stages. Maroun Najjar, who joined Patch as the first designer in the company, was all too familiar with this. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637319861/blog/Small_image_Patch_w800.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMaroun was responsible for everything from product design and UI language to creating brand assets and brand guidelines. With so many tasks pulling him in different directions, he needed to simplify his workflow wherever possible. \n\n## Giving the sales team the right tools for the job\n\nWhen Maroun started at Patch, equipping the sales team with decks was an immediate priority. For a company in an emerging industry like carbon removal, masterful storytelling is a must. \n\n\"We all know there is too much carbon in the atmosphere. Step one is to stop emitting it. But step two — which is going to take us many decades — is to pull it back out so we can reverse the damage that's been done,” Maroun explains. “On one end, we help businesses offset their carbon footprint. And on the other, we help carbon removal projects and small businesses get sales, get funding, and enable them to really scale their operations.”\n\nPatch needs to do more than just sell to prospective customers: They also need to explain the need for their product and give clients background information about the industry as a whole. \n\n“Our sales team needs to do a lot of education,” Maroun explains. “Everyone we talk to is at a different stage of knowledge, but the team was really good at meeting clients where they were.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Patch’s sales team had a strong narrative and knew how to tailor it to an individual prospect’s needs, they didn’t have the right tools to [translate this story into slides](https://pitch.com/use-cases/slideshow-maker). At the time, they were using Google Slides, but it wasn’t effectively showcasing the team’s great work. \n\n“Google Slides just wasn’t serving our needs. It didn't live up to the quality of the storytelling and selling,” Maroun says. “They were doing all of this with what was essentially a wooden spoon, when they should have been given a chef's knife.”\n\nPretty quickly, it became apparent to Maroun that he needed to find the team a better solution, one that offered both structure and flexibility. He wanted to equip them with beautiful core visuals and templates they could reuse and tweak, but also a sandbox to play in to support their storytelling.\n\nThis would help the team’s storytelling skills shine while giving Maroun the ability to focus on scaling other elements of the company’s design systems, instead of designing individual sales decks. \n\n## Making the switch to Pitch early on\n\nAs Maroun began to seek out other options, he wanted to find something fresh. As a veteran designer, he was familiar with all the major players in the presentation world. \n\n“I've worked extensively in Google Slides — it’s my least favorite. I worked in Keynote quite a bit, but it doesn't hit the mark collaboration-wise,” he explains. \n\n“I needed something that could help us tell really beautiful visual stories without requiring me to design every single slide. It had to have strong design features, be built to scale, and allow people to work quickly.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“I needed something that could help us tell really beautiful visual stories without requiring me to design every single slide.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch had promise, but as a newer product, he wanted to know he was making the best long-term investment for the team. Seeing the What’s New page and Pitch’s weekly release cadence instilled confidence that Patch and Pitch could grow together. \n\n“I went through and read all of the previous release notes, and the speed and the velocity of the team there just makes me feel like if something we need isn't in Pitch today, it'll be there soon.”\n\nOnce he started exploring templates, he knew he had the right tool to support the sales team’s storytelling. Maroun set up flexible templates for the go-to-market and supply teams with a variety of layouts, messages, and explainers. With these templates, anyone could quickly put together a personalized deck without having to create anything from scratch. \n\n“With Pitch, we can create presentation templates that have all the visuals the sales team needs, and then let them pick and choose what they want to use for any individual conversation.”\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/bbc34ef6-b9c7-4d74-86c9-32d5d03fc222\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMaroun was sold, but the next step was getting the team on board. At first, he faced hesitation. It was easier to stick to the status quo than investing the time to learn a new tool.\n\n\"There's always a degree of, ‘I have a lot of work to do, and now you're asking me to learn a new tool.’ But I think what really got people to download the software was that we'd created a really beautiful template,” he says.\n\nBy setting up templates for the team, Maroun made it simple for the rest of his team to get started and quickly see the value Pitch had to offer. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1637660855/blog/patch_deck_test.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637320145/blog/1_collaboration_patch.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“They wanted to uplevel their visual communication, and that got them in. Then they quickly got up and running with Pitch — I think it took probably a week to get everyone on board and using it actively. That's really impressive for new productivity software — that's a very fast adoption curve.\" \nUnlocking more power, collaboration, and inspiration \n\nWith Pitch, Maroun can spend more time supporting the sales team in the right ways, and the sales team can do what they do best. Making the transition to Pitch unlocked three main benefits for the team: more power, more collaboration, and more inspiration.\n\n\"Now, we have a much more powerful tool to help our sales folks go out and tell the stories they need to tell. Visually, their work is on a completely different level than it used to be, and that's thanks to what Pitch has enabled. Pitch helps us make really beautiful work, and that bolsters the storytelling our sales folks can do. In my mind, that was one of the core reasons we decided to go with Pitch.\" \n\nIn addition to helping them deliver a stronger final product, Pitch has given the team a smarter way to work together. \n\n\"Pitch has allowed us to get a lot more organized around our message and to learn from one another. The workspace and collaboration features have empowered the team to unify how we talk about our product and its benefits.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Maroun is excited for what’s to come and inspired by the possibilities of what Pitch will release next.\n\n\"When new updates ship, they uplevel us a bit more. Pitch is helping the team evolve as we go.\"\n\nAs Patch’s design team grows, Maroun can rest easy knowing that Pitch will scale with them, constantly helping them achieve more and work more efficiently. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Pitch helps us make really beautiful work, and that bolsters the storytelling our sales folks can do.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How an agency that doesn’t pitch uses Pitch","visible-title":"How an agency that doesn’t pitch uses Pitch","date":"2023-03-20T10:47:25.388Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Sarah Kiefer","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679062052/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Header_MOBILE_MAD_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679061937/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Header_SMALL_MAD_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679062097/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Header_MID_MAD_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679062125/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Header_BIG_MAD_w1920.png","image-description":"","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679062162/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_MAD.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679062175/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Social_share_MAD.png","tweet-text":"MAD designs and develops digital products.

Smack dab in the middle of their homepage sits their number one company commandment: “We don’t pitch.” So what are they doing using a tool called Pitch?**\n\nMAD has worked on some of the most innovative and beautiful products around — think [Frontify](https://www.frontify.com), [Dance](https://dance.co/), and [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). The reason they don’t pitch is simple: They don’t need to. Their work speaks for itself. \n\nThe agency wins new contracts from companies that admire products they’ve worked on, see them winning awards, or are referred by other clients. To MAD, “pitching” means a public tender process — agencies compete for the sake of competing, with little hope of beating out the incumbent agency that’s been working with the client for years. \n\nHere’s how MAD’s business director and cofounder Sebastian Waters puts it: “We’d rather spend time developing great digital products than waste weeks on opportunistic pitch processes. We’re not just service providers — we’re experts who create prototypes and work directly on the product. Teasing clients or trying to convince them with one or two days of work is not how we roll.”\n\n## Speeding up proposals while maintaining aesthetic standards\n\nWhen MAD starts exploring a project with a new client, they work from their “studio presentation” template — a standardized presentation of around 60 slides — which they then tailor to the client. Over time, the studio presentation, which is like a glossy brochure for the agency, evolves into a customized client proposal. Every client gets a presentation built for them, every time.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/d612e7c6-f700-4303-983d-eaa052527430\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:Selected slides from MAD’s studio presentation template] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch’s customization features help MAD deliver a delicate balance — the client needs to get a sense of the agency’s design approach and quality, but they also need to see their own brand reflected back at them.\n\n“The lack of custom fonts was a deal-breaker for us with Google Slides,” says Sebastian. “How can you deliver a cohesive design experience for brands if you don’t use their fonts?”\n\nMAD’s projects are inherently interactive, so including videos and other dynamic elements is also really important for bringing their ideas to life.\n\n## Making ideation fun and collaborative\n\nThe proposal and early engagement phases of a project can be some of the most fun and collaborative — ideas are flying around, and colleagues are striking creative sparks off each other. When MAD designs products, it’s key that the whole team contributes. \n\nBefore Pitch came into the picture, Keynote was the only tool that supported MAD’s level of design finesse. But that meant offline collaboration and version control hell. And a new deck had to be built from scratch each time they delivered a proposal. To keep things manageable, one designated person owned most proposal decks from start to finish.\n\nWith Pitch, the whole MAD team can contribute their ideas during the proposal stage. They can tag teammates in the deck and check out updates their colleagues have made as the vision comes together. Often, they all work on the deck at the same time and can see fellow cursors floating around as everyone crafts the presentation together. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Our process is basically: Client call, debrief, adapt the template. Within a few days, a beautiful proposal seems to come out of nowhere.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnd now the team never starts from scratch. Instead, they iterate on their core studio presentation template — which means more time to think up innovative design solutions and cater to the specific needs of a client. \n\nJürgen Hassler, MAD’s creative director and cofounder, loves how quickly everything comes together. “Our process is basically: Client call, debrief, adapt the template. Within a few days, a beautiful proposal seems to come out of nowhere and is sent off for review.”\n\n## Control over sharing, and flexibility to experiment\n\nBefore Pitch, MAD shared their proposals and project updates with clients via what Sebastian calls “the boring PDF.” But this presented two major practical disadvantages beyond the design limitations: no ability to update slides and evolve the deck over time, and no control over sharing. \n\n“Sometimes, larger clients need to socialize an idea internally and asynchronously. A presentation is a great way of doing that without needing to get everyone on a Zoom call.”\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1679305304/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/Custom_Link.mp4] [poster:] [caption:Sharing a bespoke presentation with a client is simple in Pitch — just create a custom link.] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith Pitch, the team can [share a custom link](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6046701-create-custom-links-to-your-presentations) featuring the client’s brand or project name. (They can also unshare the presentation once a project is over or a new phase of the engagement has started.) If they spot an error after a presentation has been shared, they can immediately correct it without needing to resend anything. And with [presentation analytics](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5592127-view-presentation-analytics), they can see who has viewed the deck.\n\nMAD’s standard studio presentation and proposal templates are continuously updated based on feedback from clients and the insights that show them what’s resonating. \n\n“We love to try new things out, and tweak small elements of the deck,” says Jürgen. “Our studio presentation has evolved and improved a lot over time, just like we evolve and improve our product designs.”\n\n## Finally, a presentation tool that feels like Figma\n\nAs a team of strategists, designers, and tech experts, MAD’s primary work tool is Figma. It’s where they design the digital experiences that make their clients’ products stand out. \n\nWhen they discovered Pitch, they felt like they’d finally found Figma’s presentation equivalent. Pitch made sense to them — everything worked as expected, says Jürgen.\n\n“We push back when people try to make us use PowerPoint or Google Slides. We need things to look good. When you come from Figma or a similar design tool, Pitch feels familiar and easy.”\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Design-Proposal-3S7kAq4HnHNf54eUCF2jyunD\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679061925/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/design-proposal.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Design-Pitch-Deck-0nSSgC0W3aUf5sukm42UkqPX\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679061925/blog/MAD%20How%20an%20agency%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pitch%20uses%20Pitch/7e2aa1fe-174c-4295-a9cc-403a4dc4a411.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more templates ] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Design] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMAD might not pitch — but with Pitch they’ve found a canvas to showcase their work, reflect their clients’ brands, and uphold the design standards that are at the heart of everything they do.\n\nTo create your own fully customizable (and totally free) project proposal with Pitch, head over to our [template gallery](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck) — and check out [MAD's website](https://mad.ac/) to learn more."},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How Codat’s design director stopped sweating slides","visible-title":"How Codat’s design director stopped sweating slides","date":"2023-02-14T13:20:00.000Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Ariane Phipps-Morgan","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783091/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Header_MOBILE_Codat_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783091/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Header_SMALL_Codat_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783091/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Header_MID_Codat_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783090/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Header_BIG_Codat_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783090/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Codat.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783091/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Social_share_Codat.png","teaser-text":"How do you keep a team of nondesigners on brand — and find time to do the stuff you love?

Little did he know he was also going to be in charge of the company’s entire visual identity. \n\nAt the time, Codat’s sales and solutions teams were using PowerPoint to put together a steady stream of presentations for key clients and prospects. “We’re basically a Microsoft sort of company in terms of infrastructure,” says Matt. “So, naturally, we adopted the Office suite.”  \n\nBut the decks were a mess. They passed back and forth between stakeholders who needed to weigh in. Every time someone updated a fact or figure, fonts were changed and text placements shifted. Version control was, well, out of control: **_v1** became **_final_v1** became **final_final_final_v1**. \n\nConfusion abounded. Time was wasted. The nightmare was real.  \n\nKeeping the decks visually consistent and up to date was obviously important — but it was also painstaking, tedious work. Matt’s question was simple: How do I empower other people to do what I do, so I can free up time to focus on stuff that’s more important (and fun)? In short, how do I turn nondesigners into slide designers?  \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1675872942/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Small_image_Codat_w800.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1676378987/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/1_Small_image_Codat_w800_1.jpg] [caption:With Pitch, there’s no version chaos — everything’s in the cloud.

Templates? Check. Collaboration? Double-check. But then he fell in love. The sky parted, birds sang, and the sun shone on his furrowed designer’s brow. His prayers had been answered: custom fonts.\n\n“It sounds like such a tiny thing, but as ‘brand guardian’ — or whatever the term is — custom fonts were a big thing for me. I was like, ‘Thank God. Someone’s finally figured out how to do it properly.’” \n\nAnd it was all in the cloud. \n\nAs a web-first application, Pitch would make collaborating on Codat’s decks easy. It meant everyone would see the same thing in real time. It meant people could [leave comments on slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments) for others to review async. It meant that changes would be saved automatically.

Now he just needed to convince Codat’s diehard PowerPoint proponents.\n\n## Making the switch to Pitch\n\nWhen push came to shove, there wasn’t really any shoving… or pushing. Instead, Matt let Pitch speak for itself. \n\nTo get things moving, he focused on convincing a few key colleagues in sales and solutions. “I just got the ears of the people that I knew would benefit from Pitch. I told them, ‘It kills all the bits you hate about both PowerPoint and Google Slides, and keeps your hands on brand control.’ And then I let them sell it to their teams.” \n\nOnce he’d gotten them to look at — and try — Pitch, there was no going back. Any worries about having to learn how to use a new piece of software were outweighed by the perks. The teams were happy to be able to collaborate in just one, always up-to-date deck. Not having to go back and forth between versions saved them hours of work and hassle. And with custom-designed templates, they knew their materials were always sleek and on brand.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1675783090/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/2_Diagram_of_steps_to_Pitch_adoption__w1200.jpg] [alt:] [caption:Steps to adoption: Design Director → Sales + Solutions colleagues → CEO] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBefore the team could fully [switch to Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/switch-to-pitch), there was one final person to win over: Codat’s CEO. But once the sales and customer teams had used Pitch and seen the benefits firsthand, “he was going to have to pull it out of their cold, dead hands. It just looked so much better and was quicker and far easier to use.”\n\n## One and done templates\n\nCodat’s use cases are many and varied, so creating a set of rules that allowed team members to tailor slides to their needs was crucial. Putting together the design blueprint itself was a breeze, though. \n\n“One day,” Matt remembers, “I just built out a template very quickly. It literally took me about four or five hours max to create 18 different basic slides. And I said, ‘There you go, have at it,’ held a little workshop for Pitch, and off we went.” \n\nThe template includes multiple versions of purpose-built slides. If someone on the sales team needs to talk about a customer, for instance, they might want to emphasize images or words to varying degrees — so there are three different customer story slide templates. And then there are also “bits that are unique to selling our business, like slides on networking, data, and infrastructure,” which teams keep updated with the latest assets.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1676303092/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Large_image_Codat.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1676371829/blog/Codat%20customer%20story/Large_image2_Codat.jpg] [caption:Selected slides from Codat's design template] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Designing decks for success\n\nCodat isn’t a design company, but design has become a core part of its offering — and its success.

Today, with about 250 employees, keeping the brand consistent across teams and channels, both internally and externally, is more important than ever.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“With Pitch, you can essentially enable people who aren’t designers to be designers.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGabriel MacSweeney, Codat’s Head of Brand and Communications, says “It’s great to have something where you can essentially enable people who aren’t designers to be designers.

Our aim was to celebrate female and nonbinary founders, and call on investors to deliver them a greater share of capital. On the occasion of IWD 2023, I'm taking a fresh look at the current state of female entrepreneurship, and the road ahead.\n\nOver the past year, the economic climate has changed dramatically — and the numbers have gotten worse as recession-wary investors retreat into familiar patterns. In 2022, the proportion of capital invested in female-founded startups dropped to 1.9% in the US. Meanwhile, in Europe, the percentage of funding raised by women-only teams has [gone from 3% to just 1%](https://tech.eu/2022/12/07/the-worrying-state-of-european-tech-in-2022/) since 2020.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1678109208/blog/IWD-2023/1_IWD2023_w800.png] [alt:Visual showing the drop in female-founded investment in the US (2.3% in 2020 to 2.4% in 2021 to 1.9% in 2022) and in Europe (3% in 2020 to 1% in 2021 to 1% in 2022)] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe numbers are disheartening, but the year ahead is full of opportunities. Here are my thoughts on how the startup landscape will evolve, and how female founders can invest in themselves — with or without the industry's support.\n\n## Lean into fundamentals over flash when pitching\n\nFemale-founded startups in the US only received 1.9% of VC funds in 2022, right? That percentage [shot up to 17.2%](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/women-founded-startups-raised-1-9-of-all-vc-funds-in-2022-a-drop-from-2021/) when the team was mixed-gender. \n\nFounding teams with men on them receive the lion's share of investment, but it's not because their ventures are more likely to succeed. In fact, women-led businesses are usually a [better bet](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet). In 2021, they [delivered 35% greater return](https://sb.co/female-founder-stats/) on investment than their male-founded counterparts. \n\nSo why have men historically won at pitching? For one, they tend to offer more sweeping visions and optimistic projections. In boom times, that worked as VCs prioritized vision over due diligence when choosing who to back. But now the tide is turning. More investors want to see [revenue, resilience, and runway](https://pitch.com/blog/recession-ready-growth-guide) — and female founders’ greater command of business fundamentals can play to their advantage.\n\nIt’s not just that women are more competent, although there is [some truth](https://hbr.org/2019/06/research-women-score-higher-than-men-in-most-leadership-skills) to that! Women-led teams [face more scrutiny](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/11/in-today-s-uncertain-climate-female-founders-face.html) and pushback from investors during the fundraising process. This means they need to know the complexities of their strategy inside out, and how to [deliver a flawless pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/steps-to-delivering-a-standout-pitch) that can withstand even the toughest questions. \n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Mobile-App-Pitch-Deck-4Eacbs2jnaM35Tyygi2VEZBJ\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1644575677/use-case/presentation-maker/Mobile-App-Pitch-Deck.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Investor-Pitch-Deck-52NJt62Vk3cZ5g7Hgb3XGSPG\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1644597997/use-case/presentation-maker/Investor-PitchDeck.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Build a winning pitch deck] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYou might have to work harder and jump more hurdles than men to win funds. But stick to the story you want to tell. It will resonate with the right investors — and when you get the capital, you’ll be better positioned to thrive and succeed. \n\n## Secure support through a like-minded network\n\nThe past few years have been a roller coaster. Global crises like the pandemic, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and extreme weather events have highlighted existing problems and created new ones. Many people are turning these challenges into opportunities to build socially responsible startups — and women are leading the way. \n\nA [Gusto survey](https://gusto.com/company-news/new-business-owner-survey-2022) found that 49% of 2021’s new entrepreneurs in the US were women, up from 28% in 2019. Here in Germany, we’re not far behind. According to a report by [the German Startups Association](https://startupverband.de/fileadmin/startupverband/mediaarchiv/research/ffm/Female_Founders_Monitor_2022_English.pdf), 42% of new entrepreneurs were women in 2022. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1678105409/blog/IWD-2023/5_IWD2023__w800.png] [alt:Women-led businesses yield better team performance, more profitable outcomes, and a more inclusive vision of the future.] [caption:Women-led businesses yield better team performance, more profitable outcomes, and a more inclusive vision of the future.] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s been shown that bringing more women into the male-dominated VC culture can broaden the scope of potential investments and make a higher number of socially impactful ideas come to life. \n\nSome savvy firms are catching on. \n\nThis year, Berlin’s [Speedinvest](https://www.speedinvest.com/) announced a program to back emerging VCs, at least half of which will be women or people from underrepresented backgrounds. Their first partnership is with [Fund F](https://fund-f.com/), a €20M fund for female founders set up by the Austrian VC firm [Female Founders](https://www.female-founders.org/). It joins VC funds like [Pink Salt Ventures](https://www.pinksaltventures.com/) in the UK, [Sista](https://sistafund.com/) in France, and [Auxxo](https://www.auxxo.de/) here in Germany that have recently raised money for female-founded teams. In the US, female-led VC firms like [Rethink Impact](http://rethinkimpact.com/) and [Fabric](https://www.fabricvc.com/) are also driving funds toward female founders.\n\n[I’ve said it before](https://www.businessinsider.com/check-out-these-5-pitch-decks-from-successful-female-founders-2022-3), but making an effort to meet industry leaders, get good intros, and network with other like-minded female founders is so important. Seek out VC firms that are women-led or have a record of investing in women. Find a female mentor to review your [pitch deck structure](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-deck-structure) and give you tips on your pitch delivery. There are resources out there — take advantage of them.\n\n## Leverage your differences to shine in male-dominated spaces\n\nIt’s a fact that women-led businesses have a higher success rate over the long haul. If investors were looking at the data, they’d be doling out money to female founders left and right. \n\nUnfortunately, as the economy turns south, most investors are doubling down on founders that look, think, and sound like them — white men with degrees from Harvard, MIT, or Stanford. In a funny but sobering article, TechCrunch refers to venture capitalists as “[vibe capitalists](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/long-live-the-vibe-capitalist/),” and I couldn’t agree more.\n\nThe culprit? Bias, with a capital B. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“If investors were looking at the data, they’d be doling out money to female founders left and right.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s one thing to experience a need firsthand, and another to convince an audience that has no idea what you’re talking about. It can be hard, for instance, to get male investors to see the potential value of ideas related to [femtech](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/the-dawn-of-the-femtech-revolution) or childcare. This isn’t just a gender problem — when entrepreneurs pitch products targeting individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds than the average VC investor, [it’s the same story](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet).\n\nAddressing investor biases is necessary, but it’s not a quick fix. In the meantime, you can subvert these biases by speaking to what VCs know — but from a new angle. I’d love to see more women put their own twist on traditionally male sectors and succeed. \n\nWe’re already seeing this happen in fintech. In 2022, [just 6.5%](https://findexable.com/news-and-insights/europe-performs-average-on-the-diversity-scales-with-london-paris-and-berlin-providing-positive-results-in-certain-areas/) of founders in Europe’s leading tech vertical were women, but they raised a big portion of the most high-profile funding rounds. [Yoko Spirig](https://pitch.com/blog/how-yoko-spirig-from-ledgy-builds-a-pitch-deck) of [Ledgy](https://ledgy.com/), Margot and Alexia de Broglie of [YourJuno](https://www.yourjuno.co/), Anne Boden of [Starling Bank](https://www.starlingbank.com/)… they’re all doing really exciting things.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/8c7d518c-2396-477b-bc47-61989905a4f9\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:Ledgy’s founder Yoko Spirig used this pitch deck to raise $10M in Series A funding.] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Confronting biases — and the confidence gap\n\nWhen we see a figure like 1.9%, it’s easy to blame the system. But in reality, investment is a two-way street. Both investors and founders need to cultivate a growth mindset to effect lasting change.\n\nSo to end, let’s start with you, VCs.\n\nAs the people who write the checks, you have the most power to make a difference. Investing in women is still perceived as high-risk — but as we know, the numbers clearly refute that. I’ve mentioned the structural bias that might be blocking your commitment to companies that have the most compelling growth potential, and leading you instead to fall back on familiar fare. \n\nAt Pitch, we created a deck on [reducing unconscious biases](https://pitch.com/presentations/Reducing-unconscious-biases-in-hiring-097TSM38NYwx4knmWo5aEFBy) in hiring as a resource for other startups and teams. The learnings are equally applicable to funding situations. Confronting your biases takes some reflective work, but you can bet your bottom dollar it’s worth taking a hard look at where you stand.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/20b008e3-7e02-4aa2-b9e8-60c8e8f7b925\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnd female founders, as the system works toward long-term change, you can increase your chances of success by advocating for yourselves in its current flawed state.\n\nConfidence, of course, plays a big role here. Whenever you can, ask for bigger investments. Don’t undersell your company. And as someone who can decide your own salary, be sure to pay yourself fairly — a recent [Sifted article](https://sifted.eu/articles/founder-salaries-2023/) reports that in 2022, female startup founders in Europe paid themselves nearly 25% less than men. \n\nBut self-worth mantras can only get you so far when you’re working in a system that’s actively working against you. So take a look around — is your environment enabling you to speak up and making you feel like you’re heard and respected, or is it cutting you down for having a different opinion? Do your due diligence before entering an investor partnership. Evaluate the people you’re working with, and make sure they’re worth your time. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Self-worth mantras can only get you so far when you’re working in a system that’s actively working against you.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFemale founders, I want to hear about your experiences! Have investors been more helpful — or absent — lately? Share your thoughts with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vstock/). \n\nAnd be sure to check out our [Female-Founded Startups](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) collection for a glimpse of the great work happening.

Now, Help Scout uses Pitch to keep transparency high across its remote team, and it’s even become a secret weapon for recruiting top talent. \n\n[Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.com/) helps companies improve every interaction with their customers. In an industry inhabited by the likes of Salesforce and Zendesk, Help Scout’s dedication to innovation, focus, and agility is its competitive edge. As the company has grown in size and ambition, the team has continuously rethought its toolkit to keep that edge.  \n\nA fully remote company, Help Scout’s team spans more than 60 cities across the globe. For them, the ability to easily collaborate with one another is essential in any software they choose. \n\nHelp Scout’s CEO and co-founder Nick Francis was originally a Keynote power user, but he often found himself on an island.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1628691161/blog/Small_image_HelpScout_w800.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“The problem with Keynote is that collaboration sort of sucks,” he says. Working together on slides was a struggle. He needed something design-forward yet cloud-friendly that could support the kind of seamless collaboration required by a globally distributed team.\n\n## Getting the organization to make the switch to Pitch \n\nFor Nick, it was clear that a rethink of his presentation software was in order. In order to commit to the change, he wanted to pressure test Pitch before rolling it out to his team.\n\n“I’m pretty picky about the products we adopt as a company,” Nick explains. “I’m asking 125 people to change their workflow, and I want to be respectful of that task. But great product people like Rahul at Superhuman had wonderful things to say about Pitch, and I knew about the founding team, so I was keen to give it a try.” \n\nNick is a forward-thinking leader who wanted to equip his team with the best tech stack possible. But in order for everyone in the organization to understand the value of using Pitch, they needed to see it in action for themselves. \n\nAt the time, Help Scout’s sales team was using a mix of Keynote and Google Slides, but each came with its own obstacles. The sales reps didn’t like sharing decks in Keynote, and the decks they made in Google Slides were often off-brand.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nAt the time, Help Scout’s sales team was using a mix of Keynote and Google Slides, but each came with its own obstacles.] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“I hated the fact that they were using Google Slides to present our product because it just didn't feel like we were putting our best foot forward,” Nick says.\n\nAt some point, the sales reps stopped using the decks in calls altogether, which was a problem, as their story was their competitive edge. \n\n“We’re in the customer support market — we’re never going to build more features than Zendesk or Salesforce. That’s not what our go-to-market is about,” Nick explains. “It’s very important that we tell a good story and frame our place in the market relative to our competitors. Without a slide deck, it’s impossible to do that.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“It’s very important that we tell a good story and frame our place in the market relative to our competitors. Without a slide deck, it’s impossible to do that.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNick decided it was time to step in to help refine the narrative — this time, using Pitch. He set up a style using their brand’s colors and fonts, giving sales reps the freedom to personalize decks without worrying about the design. With Pitch in place, the sales team spent less time making presentations and started to feel real pride in their slides.\n\n“I want everyone on our team to feel like they’ve got design superpowers, and that they can create an on-brand presentation that's impressive to others and that they can be proud of. It’s way easier to do that in Pitch, and that’s everything for us.”\n\n## Attracting top talent with a new way to recruit\n\nWith Help Scout’s sales deck back on-brand and on track, the team began to discover that they’d just scratched the surface when it came to Pitch’s utility across the organization. \n\n“There's all sorts of ways that we started to use the product,” Nick says. “I just sort of set the tone by using it in a number of spots and then opened it up to the team.”\n\nBefore long, the recruiting team hit on something brand new: using Pitch as a more engaging way to communicate about open roles. Instead of sharing dry, text-based job descriptions with candidates, Help Scout’s team started preparing rich, expressive slide decks. \n\nThese hiring pitch decks included details about the role and opportunity, while also sharing what Help Scout was looking for in an ideal candidate and what they're all about as a company.\n\n“When we share these, people are blown away. There's people in our recruiting funnel whose attention we never would have gotten if it wasn't for an asset like this.”\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/6daf9936-b12a-4aae-9134-c59ed5763e97?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBeyond being easy for candidates to consume, hiring pitches have proven easy for recruiters to send. All it takes is a public link to Pitch; no need to worry about attaching PDFs or finding the most up-to-date version of a deck. \n\nNow, during the hiring process, Help Scout’s recruiters even ask candidates to present back to them in Pitch. \n\n“One candidate used a Pitch template to present his project. It looked fantastic, and he talked about how much he loved using it. It’s a cool way to bring out people’s creativity without them feeling intimidated. Everyone wants to be a designer, but it’s a super intimidating craft.” \n\n## Help Scout’s remote team finds focus and flow\n\nThese days, Help Scout has adopted Pitch for much more than sales decks and hiring pitches. Board meetings, town halls, conference presentations, and creative briefs all run on Pitch, and increasingly, it’s becoming the de facto source for prep materials to keep meetings productive and focused. \n\n“As a fully remote team that’s trying to operate in an efficient way, we’ve moved toward meeting pre-reads. Every important meeting or strategic meeting has a pre-read.”\n\nPre-meeting briefs in Pitch summarize key information for stakeholders to skim through, while also offering the freedom to link out to more information for those who want to dig in deeper. \n\nWith Pitch now broadly in use, Nick has a new understanding of the flow of work in his organization, as well as what people are working on and interested in. With presentation views, he’s able to learn how his teammates discover and consume work. \n\n“One thing that I've noticed that’s really interesting is that people have started looking into decks from other teams,” he notes. “It’s a really cool thing to lean into the serendipity of seeing new presentations and opening them to check out what the rest of the organization is working on.”\n\n## Helping Help Scout win across the board\n\nFor Nick, what started as a search for a better way to collaborate on slides has produced much more. \n\nHelp Scout’s sales team is winning work with the confidence that they’re on-brand, the recruiting team’s hiring pitches are catching the attention of top candidates with creative storytelling, and the whole team is better prepared for focused meetings and better briefed on the latest work happening around the organization.\n\nIn Help Scout’s mission to help companies improve every interaction with their customers, agility, and creativity are their calling cards, and switching to Pitch has helped those values flourish. \n\nPut succinctly by Nick himself, “Presentations are amazing at helping folks translate ambiguity into clarity.”\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Voices"],"title":"How JRNY's pitch deck stood out to investors","date":"2022-07-26T17:17:04.644Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":true,"author":"Athena Lam","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610572/blog/jrny/Header_MOBILE_FounderQA_JRNY_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610574/blog/jrny/Header_SMALL_FounderQA_JRNY_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610572/blog/jrny/Header_MID_FounderQA_JRNY_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610573/blog/jrny/Header_BIG_FounderQA_JRNY_w1920.png","image-description":"","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610572/blog/jrny/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_FounderQA_JRNY.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656610573/blog/jrny/Social_share_FounderQA_JRNY.png","meta-image-description":"","teaser-text":"In this interview, Lea Marolt Sonnenschein, CEO and Founder of JRNY, breaks down the fundraising process for first-timers, by sharing her secrets to connecting with the right investors.\n","excerpt":"Bootstrapped in 2021 by founder and CEO Lea Marolt Sonnenschein, JRNY is a personal career coach powered by AI and human curation.

Think Duolingo meets Headspace for career coaching on Slack. \n\nThrough daily bite-sized exercises and on-demand access to coaching, JRNY helps users show their careers who’s boss and have better conversations with their managers. It also enables companies to coach teams in a highly scalable way. The product is in beta and currently onboarding early customers. They’re currently seeking to raise £500,000 in a pre-seed round.\n\nIn this Q\u0026A, Lea breaks down the fundraising process for first-time founders, and shares her secrets to finding and connecting with the right investors. \n\n- - -\n\n### Let’s start with your elevator pitch for JRNY.  \n\n**Lea:** JRNY is your personal career coach that lives on Slack, powered by AI. We help employees navigate their careers with clarity and confidence through bite-sized exercises and personalized insights on Slack.\n\nOne of the big issues for employers is the cost of staff. They’re expensive to recruit, expensive to train, and expensive to retain. We help companies prevent disengagement and attrition, and improve their culture and employee satisfaction with actionable steps based on anonymized data.\n\nFor example, we track how employees feel about eight key areas of workplace satisfaction. Let’s say “recognition” is really low. We’d then recommend that the company educate their managers to be more proactive with celebrating wins and giving feedback and share some partners who could support with training and workshops. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/123b259b-6a32-480f-9558-cae7f8ed35b2\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Were there any big changes to your deck before the final version we see here?\n\n**Lea:** The deck went through so many changes, and it’s actually evolved quite a bit from [the version on Pitch](https://pitch.com/presentations/JRNY-Pitch-Deck-5oekek5vmZ3F5fw2oW6uUnBP?slide=1127d1f9-8244-40ed-99e3-82601f95dd07)! The biggest change I made before posting it on Pitch was making a catchy intro page, because I saw how bland it looked compared to the other decks in the [Female-Founded Startups collection](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8). \n\nThis is the original intro slide, which isn’t that eye-catching:  \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656682764/blog/jrny/jrny-original-pitch-deck-cover.png] [alt:JRNY's original pitch deck cover with the company name with a white background. Tag line is \"career strategy at scale\".] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Did you notice any changes once you switched out the opening slide? \n\n**Lea:** Yes! It seems to get a chuckle out of people, and really helps drive home the main point, which is the chatbot. Before, we didn’t get to that until midway through the deck. \n\nOne of the slides that people love the most is our “iceberg” slide. I hear time and time again how great that slide is. I did all the illustrations myself. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/123b259b-6a32-480f-9558-cae7f8ed35b2/53d015fc-8c5b-43b0-a666-b15eac0814ef\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Wow! You have to get creative when you’re bootstrapped. Founders say fundraising is a full-time job. Can you break down what goes into it for future first-time founders?\n\n**Lea:** It’s hard — much harder than I thought it was going to be. For example, one thing that took up time was identifying our investors and company fit. This involved: \n\n1. Looking for lists and databases of angel investors and funds\n2. Researching each and every one of them \n3. Matching their investment thesis with our product\n4. Putting that into a spreadsheet to track it across the cycle \n5. Reaching out to people for warm introductions \n\nI spent so much time applying through VC websites, because I thought that someone was actually looking at them on the other end. It wasn’t worth it because 98% of the time they don’t. \n\nOnce I figured out cold outreach wasn’t working, my job became all about scheduling meetings, chasing people, keeping on top of email threads, and more. This is on top of crafting the pitch deck, the pitch itself, the data room, answering all the questions someone might ask, and more. I never know when someone might reply, and then have to drop everything immediately to jump on a call. \n\n### How do you balance that while also trying to build a product?\n\n**Lea:** You forget about the word “balance” for a while — at least in my case. I’m a product manager by heart, so I love building products, and can’t wait to talk to users. I ensure to make time for that even though fundraising is top priority.\n\nOur experience has been that when you include the users in the building and the conversation, they’re in it with you. They’ve got your back. That’s why we’re seeing so many of our users refer their coworkers, peers, and friends. They believe in the mission, and they believe in me. \n\n### There have been so many layoffs at large companies lately. What’s your snapshot feeling about fundraising today?\n\n**Lea:** You can see two camps in the VC community. One wants to stop everything right now — these are folks who were pouring money into companies that focused on growth over revenue, and acted more out of FOMO than anything else. I wouldn’t want to partner with them anyway. The other camp realizes that NOW is the time to invest and get a great deal. \n\nI’ve seen what major layoffs do to the people who stay, and it sucks. Motivation is down, there’s a ton of uncertainty, and people start to disengage. This is precisely when companies need JRNY, so that they can make sure the people who stay and are crucial to the success of the business feel supported, engaged, and motivated.\n\n### What skills would you like to take forward into your next round of fundraising? \n\n**Lea:** This is more a heads-up than a skill: Never reach out cold. Always go through a warm connection. Things will happen much faster. All our current angels happened through warm connections, and all the time and effort spent doing cold outreach was just wasted. \n\nThe actual skill I’ll need again is keeping a people CRM and managing that — I’m using Airtable. I wasn’t the most organized person when we started, but this process certainly forced me to become one. \n\n### Can you share any other observations about the fundraising process so far with other first-time founders? \n\n**Lea:** It’s hard, but you’ll learn a lot doing it. There are no shortcuts, and you just have to keep grinding at it. Most importantly, don’t give up. There are thousands of investors out there, and someone, somewhere will fund you. But don’t be surprised if it takes a few months. Some of my founder friends spent nine to twelve months fundraising before finally closing a round. \n\nAlso, don’t underestimate accelerators. They’re a great hub-and-spoke approach to closing your first round. The equity you give up is negligible in terms of the trust mark and access to investors you get afterward. \n\n- - -\n\nJRNY’s [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/JRNY-Pitch-Deck-5oekek5vmZ3F5fw2oW6uUnBP?slide=1127d1f9-8244-40ed-99e3-82601f95dd07) can be found in Pitch’s [Female-Founded Startups](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) collection.\n\nYou’ve just read the third interview in our Founder Q\u0026A series.  Keep an eye out for future Q\u0026As with successful founders — and in the meantime, start building your own deck with one of Pitch’s [free templates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck).

They chose Pitch to save time on routine decks, but they soon made it part of their scaling business' core collaboration stack.\n\nLinear is building a new standard for modern software development. It helps high-performance teams to streamline their software projects, sprints, tasks, and bug tracking. As a company that is reinventing how product teams work, they’re no stranger to adopting new tools that help them work faster across departments and time zones. But when it came to their presentation software, they were stuck in the past. \n\nAs a former designer, Karri Saarinen, Co-Founder and CEO, was accustomed to Keynote, despite its limitations. “Keynote has always been my go-to, but obviously the challenge there is collaboration and sharing.”\n\n## Removing barriers to collaboration and sharing\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1645717548/blog/Small_image_Linear_w800.jpg] [alt:Profile photos of Karri Saarinen, Co-founder and CEO at Linear Erin Frey, Customer Experience, and Zoe Bauer, Chief of Staff.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBack in 2019, Linear was a small but fast-growing startup. Managing board decks in Keynote was no big deal if there was only one editor, but as the team started to scale, it started to feel the pains of dated software. Sending files back and forth, working in silos, and managing multiple versions were behaviors at odds with Linear's typical ways of working. \n\nFor a while, they were able to forgo presentations entirely and share updates through text-based tools. However, the visual nature of slides makes it easier to follow topics and digest information. That’s when Linear switched to Pitch for meetings. Karri explains, “I think a presentation can be easier or more engaging to look at instead of sharing a text document.” \n\nThe Linear team needed a solution that lived up to their high standards around collaboration, outstanding design, and ease of use. \n\n## Presentations: The key for better focus and meetings   \n\n### A single place for all-hands updates\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1645563462/blog/Linear_sharing_link__w1200.jpg] [alt:A screenshot of a Linear team member who is about to share a community chat presentation deck with an external user.

At the bottom right corner, the link to current slide option is toggled off and there is a copy link option.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSpread across countries, most of Linear’s work happens asynchronously. But every Tuesday, the team — which spans San Francisco to Helsinki — has one real-time meeting, where they can align on current projects and updates as a group. \n\nMoving to Pitch meant saving hours on meeting prep and giving Linear’s global team more freedom to update their slides without generating multiple versions of their all-hands deck. Now, Chief of Staff Zoe Bauer can quickly create and circulate a new weekly meeting agenda and [assign slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) to individuals. And the Linear team can open their browser or desktop app to check slide assignments and update their respective slides. \n\nZoe explains, “Pitch simplifies the entire process around presentations. Templates help us save time when deciding the flow of the meeting, while also keeping us focused on the goal of our meetings. When others start to collaborate on the deck, we can assign slides, discuss updates, and sign off on content all in one place.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Templates help us save time when deciding the flow of the meeting, while also keeping us focused on the goal of our meetings.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBy removing the administrative hassle of managing files, everyone can focus on their updates and important discussion topics. Karri notes, “Presentations make me think about what I'm going to say. Presentations force people to focus and share what they're working on in a concise way.”\n\n### Data-driven board decks made simple\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1645563297/blog/Linear_Big_Assign_and_comment.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1645639831/blog/Big_Assign-and-comment_video_cover_linear.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBoard decks — which once lived locally on Karri’s machine instead of in a shared workspace — were a natural next use case. With Pitch, key team members can contribute and Zoe can check in with collaborators to keep slides on track. \n\nThe team can also quickly update numbers by importing CSV files or data from Google Sheets to create easy-to-read charts without having to manage screenshots from other tools.\n\nNow that board decks are in one accessible place, Zoe, Karri, and others can easily refer to past meetings while preparing for upcoming presentations. \n\n### An engaging way to educate customers\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/7ce98a0b-a668-4c70-a419-968bce33d069\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSeeing how easy Pitch was to use, Customer Success Manager Erin Frey started using slides for onboarding calls and community meetups. With customizable templates and seamless collaboration, she never has to worry about making sure Linear is putting their best foot forward. \n\nShe explains, “I can easily add my content in and then the design team can open the presentation and work their magic.” \n\nOnce a deck has been created, it’s easy to save as a template and reuse for different occasions like demos or even follow-up emails. Erin says, “Sometimes a customer has a question about a feature. Instead of writing a long email, it’s nice to throw a few slides together in Pitch.” \n\nShe can share a simple link, and the content will always stay up to date. \n\n## Software that scales with Linear’s ambition \n\nNow, Linear has a single source of truth for important company updates, board meetings, customer communications, and more. More than just a presentation tool, Pitch has given them a way to move faster, stay connected, and improve the way they communicate.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How Lumos raised $30M with Pitch","visible-title":"How Lumos raised $30M with Pitch","date":"2022-06-08T15:25:12.598Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089668/blog/lumos/Header_MOBILE_Lumos_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089668/blog/lumos/Header_SMALL_Lumos_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089668/blog/lumos/Header_MID_Lumos_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089668/blog/lumos/Header_BIG_Lumos_w1920.png","image-description":"Case study banner: How Lumos raised a $30M Series A with Pitch","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089667/blog/lumos/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Lumos.png","thumbnail-description":"Case study banner: How Lumos raised a $30M Series A with Pitch","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654089670/blog/lumos/Social_share_Lumos.png","meta-image-description":"Case study banner: How Lumos raised a $30M Series A with Pitch","teaser-text":"Tired of old-school software, the team at Lumos tried Pitch when they started their fundraising efforts.

How easy was it to get access to essential software, like GitHub, Dropbox, and Zoom? Chances are, there‘s some room for improvement. \n\nThat‘s where Lumos comes in. They‘re building the first AppStore for companies, boosting employee productivity by helping them easily access the software they need, while ensuring companies stay compliant and maintain visibility over their software spend. \n\nThe Lumos team modernizes enterprise application management, so they naturally look to adopt products that help modernize their internal processes. They started experimenting with Pitch for their seed round in 2020, and now it‘s their go-to presentation software. Pitch not only played a key role in their recent Series A raise but also supports their ongoing sales motion. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654691189/blog/lumos/Header_SMALL_Lumos_Employees_w1200.png] [alt:Profile shots of Brando Vasquez, Branding and Design Lead, Sandi Green, Product Marketing Lead, Chris Frank, Demand Generation Lead] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Pitching the Lumos team on a new solution\n\nBrando Vasquez, Branding and Design Lead at Lumos, joined Pitch‘s beta while still working at Microsoft. When he started working at Lumos, he was keen to bring Pitch with him. \n\nThe Lumos team is made up of professionals who’ve spent years at enterprise companies, so they‘re acutely aware of the pitfalls of tools like PowerPoint and Google Slides. Mismatched fonts, version control, outdated messaging … the list goes on. Still, changing tools and ways of working can be uncomfortable. \n\nBut Brando persisted. During his first weeks, the team put Pitch to the test against Google Slides and determined that — when it comes to business-critical work — presentation matters. \n\n“We used Google Slides for the everyday, unimportant stuff. When we wanted to build something that would really have an impact, we used Pitch,” he explains. \n\nWhy Pitch? Finally, Brando could set up [slide styles](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4059534-create-your-own-slide-style) and templates that stayed true to the brand and know that the rest of the team could comfortably and confidently work with them. \n\n“I don‘t need to worry that slides are going to be off-brand,” he says. “I can essentially create my own style guide with custom fonts and edit templates quickly — way more effectively than with PowerPoint or Keynote. I‘m happy to know that what we‘re building with Pitch are foundations that other people can work from.”\n\nWhen Lumos set out to secure seed capital, using Pitch was the obvious choice. And with that, the company officially left Google Slides behind.\n\nBrando recalls, “We raised our seed round from Andreessen Horowitz and since then, every single presentation has been on Pitch.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“We raised our seed round from Andreessen Horowitz, and since then, every single presentation has been on Pitch.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Effective fundraising with seamless collaboration \n\nBy the time Lumos was ready to secure its Series A, the team had fine-tuned their workflow in Pitch. Instead of thinking about design and passing files back and forth, they could put their full focus into communicating their product vision and securing [$30 million in funding](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/lumos-wants-to-build-an-app-store-for-the-enterprise/) led by Andreessen Horowitz \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/ac4bf31b-ab46-4972-9a72-d3705e3a2453\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs a globally distributed team, being able to work together efficiently is key. \n\nProduct Marketing Lead Sandi Green explains, “There‘s no lag time waiting for feedback on one version of a deck. When I‘m working with Brando and others, it feels like we‘re in the same room.”\n\nSince collaboration often happens asynchronously, features like [slide statuses](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) keep the team aligned on which slides need refinement.\n\nNow, what was once a lengthy back-and-forth hassle in her PowerPoint days is a simple process with a single source of truth. \n\n“There‘s no Lumos_Pitch_version_10_Final_Final_Final. That‘s not part of our reality,” she says. \n\nProtecting Lumos‘ intellectual property and sensitive financial information was top of mind during the fundraising process. With Pitch, the ability to share links with specific individuals — instead of attaching PDFs or using third-party tools — gave them the sense of security they needed as they began to court investors. \n\nDemand Generation Lead Chris Frank notes, “The permissioning is great. Our decks contain a lot of sensitive information that we don‘t want to get outside of our control.”\n\n## Transforming marketing from “glitter and glue” to getting stuff done\n\nBrand consistency and collaboration aren‘t the only reasons Lumos chose Pitch. Pitch’s template library and centralized workspaces make it easier for teams to work with approved messaging and communicate a consistent story. This is especially meaningful to Sandi, who’s responsible for ensuring everyone knows how to talk about Lumos and its products. \n\n“One of the big parts of product marketing — especially at a hypergrowth startup — is sales enablement. And sales teams love to make their own slide decks. I think one of the root causes of that is that there‘s usually no place for a singular story. One thing I‘ve loved about my time at Lumos now that we use Pitch is that we‘ve settled on a story that works, and Pitch supports that.”\n\nWith Pitch, the sales team knows exactly where to go to find approved slides, complete with the right messages. Instead of cleaning up slides and checking in on sales, Sandi can focus on more strategic initiatives. \n\n“Product marketing is not the glitter and glue team,” Sandi explains. “We‘re here to make sure the story aligns with the brand and the strategy. Having the whole company all-in on Pitch makes it easy.” \n\n## Embracing a modern collaboration stack\n\nLumos wants to empower companies to choose the best tools for their teams. And they‘re leading by example, eschewing the Google Suite for products like Notion, Figma, and Pitch. \n\n“All my tools feel very in sync with each other,” Brando notes.\n\nWith Pitch, off-brand slides, stilted collaboration, and clunky sharing are issues of the past. Now, the team can focus on bringing more modern workflows to the enterprise. \n\nInspired to be more like Lumos?

As their team size grew, so did their aspirations, and as they prepared to raise their Series A round and expand into new markets, they needed a tool that would support them at scale.\n\n[Pento](https://www.pento.io/) is a Danish company building payroll automation SaaS. Their tool connects with HR software — like BambooHR or Hibob — and accounting software to pull in the right metrics. Then, it pushes all the right outputs to your accounting software  — and just like that, you’re done running payroll.\n\nWhen Pento started using Pitch, they were a team of three working from the same office. Today, they’re a fast-growing, remote-first startup with almost 50 employees. \n\n“As a larger, distributed team, we could no longer walk over to someone’s desk to give feedback, yet we still needed effortless collaboration,” Jonas Bøgh, their co-founder and CEO explains.\n\nThe team first discovered Pitch when they were beginning to ramp up their sales function. In the early days, they were able to address most follow-up questions with a simple Notion page, but as they began to approach larger customers, they needed to develop a traditional sales deck. \n\nNotion was great, but not ideal for mapping out a customer’s existing accounting stack in a visually appealing way. As an early fan of Wunderlist, moving to Pitch was an easy decision. \n\nSoon enough, the sales team was actively using Pitch for their decks, and Jonas was able to view from afar just how easy it was for them to work between teams to create on-brand presentations. Pento’s product designer had set up their initial template, and now, after a call, a sales rep just had to pick a template, swap out the logo, and send it out. He thought, why not apply that to other use cases? \n\n## Gearing up for their Series A\n\nAfter gaining traction in the UK, Pento saw an opportunity to expand into additional European markets, like Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France. With market expansion came the need to grow the team, as well as develop their product to support integrations with the HR and accounting software preferred by each local market. The next step was to start fundraising so they would have the capital on hand to support their growth. \n\nIn 2019, Pento used Keynote for their seed round. Back then, with such a small team, Jonas took responsibility for the deck. He used an outside agency to help with key brand elements like the logo, fonts, and colors, then worked to pull it all together into a presentation. \n\n“In this case, having the deck look nice was more important than being able to collaborate or get input from others,” he explains. \n\nSince their seed round, their software stack has evolved considerably. In addition to Keynote, they also had tools like Notion, Pitch, and Figma at their disposal. When the time came to build their Series A deck, the team needed to decide which tool to use. \n\n\"Our product designer tried to pull us into using Figma,” Jonas says. “It’s a great product, but it’s not really made for decks.”\n\n## Choosing the right tool\n\nJonas didn’t want to have to choose between optimizing for design or for collaboration. With Pitch, they didn’t have to. \n\nPitch is optimized for the entire team, meaning there are features that satisfy a designer’s need for control and brand integrity, as well as features that empower anyone to contribute their ideas and feedback. For the Pento team, this meant that they didn’t need to make sacrifices on the process or the final product. Using Pitch, they could easily collaborate together to [create a beautiful, on-brand pitch deck](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips).\n\n“It just made sense,” Jonas says. “Working with Pitch had been a great experience, so there was convenience in having everything in the same place.”\n\nThey team also loved that they could all work in one presentation. Slide statuses helped them keep track of progress, and with comments they could share detailed feedback. \n\n“It worked well for us, because we didn’t have to coordinate on Slack or somewhere else to make sure we knew which slides we needed to work on,” Jonas says.  \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1626697573/blog/Pento_case_study_Big_image__w1200.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1626422498/blog/small_image_Blog_Pento-case-study_w800.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## The winning deck\n\nWith their built-in-Pitch deck, the team successfully raised $15.6 million in Series A funding by May 2021. Now they have the capital they need to expand to more countries, build more integrations, and launch their API. \n\n“This time around, our deck was clearly 10✕ better than what it was at the seed stage,” Jonas says. \"During the fundraising process, we got a lot of praise from the investors we were pitching. They said the deck looked like something you would expect to see at a much later stage and looked way more mature than what you would usually see for a Series A.”\n\nHere’s a look inside their winning pitch deck:\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/e8235876-a4fc-4274-aec5-89817924470b?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“One thing that was a huge difference for us was making sure there’s a story as you move through the deck,” Jonas explains. Instead of using titles like “team” or “traction” they made sure that the titles were contributing to a story. \n\n“That didn’t really make sense to me in the beginning. But once you have the final deck and you start flicking through the slides in a PDF, then it makes complete sense.” \n\nHe put himself in the shoes of an investor, who might have three or four minutes to review a pitch deck. When they only have time to read a few sentences per slide, it’s important that there’s a clear narrative to follow. \n\nWith Pitch, Jonas was able to invest his time into delivering the best pitch possible, not designing his deck. By making the process of building their deck painless, Pitch helped the team focus on what mattered most: perfecting their pitch, and securing their Series A.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How Pitch helps Frontify live their brand","visible-title":"How Pitch helps Frontify live their brand","date":"2022-01-27T17:21:35.672Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212835/blog/Header_MOBILE_FrontifyBP_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212834/blog/Header_SMALL_FrontifyBP_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212834/blog/Header_MID_FrontifyBP_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212834/blog/Header_BIG_FrontifyBP_w1920.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212834/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_FrontifyBP.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1643212835/blog/Social_share_FrontifyBP.jpg","meta-image-description":"How Pitch helps Frontify live their brand - case study ","teaser-text":"Learn how Frontify used Pitch to roll out their company rebranding and give teams the assets and templates to build consistent presentations.","excerpt":"Frontify simplifies brand management with a platform that connects everything (and everyone) important to the growth of a brand.

But a rebrand is also an opportunity to start fresh and give everyone the tools they need to be more effective in their roles through the use of shared assets, templates, and presentations.\n\nRick Hummel, a Product Designer at Frontify, needed a way for designers to share brand materials with other teams so they could represent the company consistently. At the time, they were using a combination of Keynote and Google Slides for presentations. Rick knew there had to be a better solution.\n\n“For us, it was clear that a [cloud-based presentation tool](https://pitch.com/use-cases/presentation-maker) was the way to go,” Rick says. “We needed to bring more brand consistency to our presentations and our company.”\n\nDespite team members’ familiarity with other presentation tools, Rick knew that investing in making [the switch to Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/switch-to-pitch) now would save them time later. Changing tools wasn’t a setback. It was a way to set themselves up for future success.\n\n“We were having the same problems as other companies using static files: People weren't downloading the most recent version of a presentation, leading to problems. As the ambassadors for brand consistency and brand excellence, we knew we needed to fix that. And our existing presentation software was not fixing that.”\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QubZA2uPcHw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThey started [rolling out Pitch to a small group of stakeholders](https://pitch.com/blog/switch-to-pitch) and members of the leadership team, and then decided the time was right to get the rest of the company on board.\n\n“It was clear for us that there was no chance to use Keynote and Pitch or something mixed. It should just be Pitch,” Rick explains.\n\nThe rebrand was a perfect opportunity to create cohesion. Instead of sending files back and forth, Pitch became the place where everyone went for new, rebranded Frontify templates.\n\n## Creating brand resources for the whole team to use\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1642699477/blog/frontify_screencase_final_loop.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1642773864/blog/frontify_screencase_final_loop_cover.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch played a key role in unveiling their new messaging and visual style, as well as providing a day-to-day resource to help put their new brand into practice.\n\nChristof Müller, Frontify’s Marketing Art Director, recalls, “After I saw how Pitch worked, I was so excited and understood exactly why this was the right moment to switch.”\n\nEven when it came to the communication around the rebrand itself, Frontify’s team centralized their work on the new brand templates in Pitch, knowing that their work would eventually save everyone time.\n\n“We wanted to find a tool where we could be collaborative. We were using Keynote, but it was too complicated to work together,” says Christof. “The tool was easy to use, even for non-designers, but what we needed to do was help people understand how to use our new brand in the right way.”\n\nBy building templates in Pitch, Frontify’s team could efficiently roll out internal education of the new brand and enable team members to bring it to life.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“The tool was easy to use, even for non-designers, but what we needed to do was help people understand how to use our new brand in the right way.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch's intuitive editing experience plays beautifully with the Frontify for Desktop app, making it easy for teams to grab the latest logos, photos, and more. And with Pitch’s template library, sharing the latest designs and messaging is only a click away.\n\n“It was so easy to save templates in the template library so everyone could access the latest versions in real time. It was great to see how people in the company embraced it — they were excited to use it for the first time.”\n\n## Delivering consistent, branded presentations to impress\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/3bdb1365-d691-4860-a578-a0ad38fbce0e\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith the internal rollout behind them, it was time for Frontify to share their brand with the world.\n\nAs Stephanie McSwiney, VP Sales at Frontify, explains, \"We stand for brand management, so brand consistency is really, really important for us, and it starts in how we communicate with our customers.”\n\nSales is a customer’s initial touch point with the Frontify brand, which means getting first impressions right is essential.\n\nBefore, Stephanie’s team struggled with presentations. Working with cumbersome Keynote files and sharing bloated attachments, it was difficult for them to know where to access the most up-to-date version of a deck.\n\n“It was really hard to share knowledge across the team — for example, to know which were the good pitch decks that worked for people and how to effectively adjust them to customer brands,” Stephanie says.\n\nShe adds, “And then aside from internal knowledge sharing, sending them out to the client was hard — PDFs were too big and inconvenient.”\n\nWith Pitch, anyone [can create a deck from a template](https://pitch.com/templates) and share a link to collaborate internally, or share externally. From sales to customer success calls, Pitch provides a knowledge library for teams to build, adapt, reuse, and externally share decks, while ensuring materials are up-to-date.\n\nThe ease of moving to Pitch, finding [templates](https://pitch.com/templates), and adapting presentations for new client pitches saved time. And with live video collaboration, Frontify employees around the world had a totally new way to work together.\n\n“In Keynote you had to upload it to your personal drive to collaborate, which was a pain and of course not very great from a security standpoint. Now, we can collaborate via live video and really work on the same slides,” Stephanie explains.\n\n“Working on slides is much more efficient, we can easily access the approved assets,” she says. “It’s a brilliant, really easy workflow.”\n\nWith less design pressure, sales can focus on how they serve customers and support Frontify’s growth. Frontify’s sales teams can also ensure that clients get the most updated decks, without sending a new file and track the open rate to see which decks perform well.\n\n“It’s really cool that when we share the presentation with clients via a link, we can see the stats on who opened it, the open rate, did the client really look at it? It’s a great way of collaborating with the client as well.”\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MURncdfxEpA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Replacing complexity with delightfully intuitive collaboration\n\nWith Pitch, Frontify is delivering on their brand promise of being perfectly consistent all the time, while enjoying the process of working together. From their design team updating brand assets to client-facing teams preparing pitches and onboarding documents, everyone can confidently build materials with brand consistency.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Customer Stories"],"title":"How Supercast raised $2 million with Pitch","date":"2020-07-02T08:18:28.741Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Aimee Millwood","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headermobile_supercast.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headersmall_supercast.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headermid_supercast.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headerbig_supercast.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/supercast_thumbnail.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/supercast_socialshare.jpg","tweet-text":"From side project to startup — How Supercast used Pitch to raise $2M and spin off a big idea into a new business","teaser-text":"From side project to startup — How Supercast used Pitch to raise $2M and spin off a big idea into a new business","excerpt":"Aidan Hornsby is a designer and video producer-turned-marketer who got his start in the tech world making videos for startups.

In the Tiny way, Supercast’s origin story is representative of this entrepreneurial spirit. After the startup Aidan had been working for was acquired, he moved to lead marketing at one of Tiny’s companies.\n\nAfter a range of collaborations, Aidan moved on to found DoubleUp with Andrew a couple of years later. As the podcasting industry exploded, DoubleUp began working with high-profile podcasters looking to move beyond advertising revenue and explore other monetization models. DoubleUp spotted the opportunity, and Supercast was born.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/75239d87-494b-4af7-96fa-0eb2ce04cbbe?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## \"We need a pitch deck, and we needed it, like, yesterday.\"\n\nSupercast helps podcasters turn their relationship with fans into real money. After a successful Product Hunt launch, they quickly began attracting attention from podcasters and investors.\n\n“We hadn’t set out to raise money, so we didn’t have a pitch deck prepared,” Aidan explains. “But a lot of people were interested in investing, so there was pressure. Turnaround time was not a week, it was: We need something now.”\n\nAs anyone who has created a [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks) knows, creating an initial draft, getting feedback from others, and then implementing this feedback to create a final version everyone is proud of is no easy feat. And it’s definitely not a task most people complete in a matter of days.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nPeople usually spend weeks on their pitch decks. Supercast had days.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAndrew and Aidan knew this all too well. They’d both been around enough pitch decks in their careers to know that in addition to the general challenge of just getting it ready, there are also all the nerve wracking times when content doesn’t save or display correctly. That’s why for this deck, Aidan and his team at Supercast sought a better solution. They were sick of the frustrations of the old way and wanted something that worked the way they did. With the clock ticking, they started throwing around some ideas. \n\n“We’d just wrapped up a DoubleUp project with Pitch so we said, 'Let’s use Pitch for this. Let’s just build it out here. Let’s literally use [these templates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks), because that’s what they’re there for.' We really jumped in headfirst. Andrew and I started throwing the link back and forth and sharing ideas in real time,\" Aidan says.\n\nWithin one day, they had their first draft.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Templates make it so easy. Having something to start from and not having to worry that we’re going to have to design from scratch is a huge time saver.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAfter they created their initial draft, it was time to start integrating feedback. Previously, Aidan’s experience collaborating on pitch decks was, as he puts it, “a lot of Keynote decks flying back and forth. These were the pre-Slack days (can you imagine?) so we had tons of files being sent back and forth by email. Version C-Final_Final, that kind of thing.”\n\nWorking between multiple companies, Aidan and Andrew faced the added challenge of collaborating with many people, across different teams and time zones. With so many like-minded creatives and entrepreneurs, Tiny is a hub for collaboration and idea sharing. But in the day-to-day of modern life, communication can quickly become chaotic.\n\n“Between Tiny, Supercast, DoubleUp, and our design team at [Z1](http://www.z1.digital), we had different people on different teams giving feedback across different channels,” Aidan says. Jumping between email, iMessage, and Slack, trying to manage the logistics of rewrites and redesigns (the all-too-familiar requests of “Can you make this look good, can you make this make sense?”) — all of this wasted valuable time. Time that the team didn’t have.\n\nAs a busy entrepreneur, trying to juggle raising a round with running an agency, Aidan had more pressing things to do than worry whether or not the team had the latest version of a pitch deck. With Pitch, working together felt seamless.\n\n“One thing I found particularly valuable in Pitch is the ability to clearly mark things as to-do’s. Slide statuses helped me navigate through the labyrinth of feedback and move away from having a dozen slides littered with messy comments.”\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/main-hb_fg6g7r.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/supercast-image.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“The ability to mark which slides were done and which ones weren’t is such a simple thing but when you have five people jumping in and out of the deck and you have someone like Andrew or me just jumping in and out, having the context to know: 'Just look at the slides with the yellow label' is really powerful for collaboration and staying focused in feedback.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"Factoring in all the time saved by Pitch's collaboration tools, we finished the first draft at least twice as fast as we would have with Keynote or Google Slides.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother feature that helped streamline the process was presentation styles. In contrast to master slides, styles function as a design system that ensure everyone working on a deck is on brand, all the time. Using styles, Aidan could easily update the font settings, typefaces, or colors, and then apply them throughout the deck. This was a game changer for a budding startup still working to nail their branding.\n\n“We hadn’t even picked a font yet. We didn’t have branding.

But with the rise of [product-led growth (PLG)](https://pitch.com/presentations/Inventing-Product-Led-Growth-5jgha65qVZB45cCYAm4UA7wb), the role of the product demo isn’t as clear-cut as it used to be. When users have already spent significant time using a product, what purpose should your demo serve, and what materials do you need to have on hand? There’s a new role for the product demo in PLG sales motions, and we’re here to help you get your demo deck right.\n\nOn their journey to scaling globally, Slack, Dropbox, and Atlassian rewrote the playbook for SaaS growth. Unlike the IT-sanctioned enterprise behemoths that came before them, these companies made it fast, easy, and fun for anyone to adopt their product and use the free version for as long as they liked — and product-led growth was born.\n\nIf you're on a sales team at a PLG-driven company, your process has likely changed — you no longer need to dazzle leads with features and value they’ve never seen before. Chances are, your prospects have already tried a lot of your product’s functionality, and felt its value. [Recent studies](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-ways-and-means-of-b2b-buyer-journey-maps-were-going-deep-at-forresters-b2b-forum/) also confirm that software buyers now prefer to conduct online research independently. \n\nIt’s time to adapt your approach. The rise of PLG means demos now have the potential to be even more powerful in moving prospects toward a purchase decision. The trick is getting them right. \n\n## Make your product demo modular\n\nProduct demos used to happen at a specific point in the sales cycle — after a discovery call, and before a prospect had used the tool. In a PLG model, a demo can happen at multiple points in the user’s experience of a product. An existing user may want to learn more about unseen value, or a champion may want to convince other team members to upgrade to the paid plan. To make things even more complex, many SaaS products today have multiple value propositions and use cases.\n\nYour demo needs to flex based on everything you know about your prospect’s business, how they’ve used your product, and the challenges they’re trying to tackle.\n\nPractically, that means creating a modular set of demo slides that can cover several of your product’s use cases as well as the overall value proposition. With a great modular demo presentation, the goal is never to deliver a perfect, preset narrative; it’s to make preparation easy, whatever the circumstances.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662042254/blog/product-demos-pls/Inline_image_product-demos-pls_w1200_-2.png] [alt:A screenshot of Pitch's editor, with a sales demo deck open.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### What makes a demo presentation effective? \n\nYour modular demo deck should set up a narrative structure for your product demo. Here’s an effective structure:\n\n1. Give context for what you’re about to show and why your product is a game changer.\n2. Help prospects understand upfront how they’ll benefit.\n3. Cover known industry problems and pain points to show you understand and empathize with your prospects’ situation.\n4. Map these pain points to your product features, and show how the features address them.\n5. Add a link to your product, and take prospects through the demo.\n6. Recap how your product demo is relevant to your prospects.\n7. Include social proof to show how similar companies are succeeding with the product. \n8. Leave space for questions and a discussion of next steps.\n\n## Use research to tailor your demo \n\nOnce you have a modular deck as a foundation, you can customize each demo based on usage data and what you know about the prospect's business. Do your research before you connect: Where are they missing value, and which parts of your modular demo will most interest them? Confirm what you'll be sharing at the start of the call. If they’d rather see something else, use your modular deck to adapt on the fly.\n\nHere’s how to prep a tailored demo in four steps:\n\n1. Get context on your prospect. Offer a discovery call to pinpoint where they see the value of your product — and understand their current business challenges. Find out who else is involved in the decision-making process, and ask about their timelines and dependencies.\n2. Where possible, fill in the blanks with research to avoid any unnecessary qualifications. Understand your prospect’s role, employer, and industry, and map these to your user personas.\n3. Analyze telemetry data to paint a picture of your prospect’s product usage to date. Know how much their team has used the product, and where there’s additional demand.\n4. Research how you acquired the user in the first place. \n\nIf the prospect is a product qualified lead, and their product usage suggests they’re already familiar with your product, skip the basics and double down on highlighting opportunities to unlock additional value. Explain your usage tiers, and lean into the return on investment they can expect from paying (or paying more) for your product.\n\nIf the data suggests your prospect is less familiar (or not familiar at all) with your product, leverage your modular deck and swap in slides that introduce your solution in more detail.\n\n## Deliver your demo at the right altitude\n\nWhen it comes to demos for PLG tools, no two prospects’ levels of familiarity will ever be the same. Here are a few tips for [delivering your presentation](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/how-to-present).\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662042254/blog/product-demos-pls/Inline_image_product-demos-pls_w1200.png] [alt:A screenshot of a demo deck being presented. The speaker view of this deck includes the demo slide as well as upcoming slides.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFirst off, don’t go granular right away. The goal of a demo isn’t to show off exactly how to use every feature. It’s to communicate information the audience needs to continue moving toward a purchasing decision. Establish a narrative that makes prospects want to expand their team’s use of your product.\n\nSecond, listen as much as you sell. Be consultative, ask questions to help you fully understand your audience’s challenges, and leave space for questions and answers throughout the demo. This hybrid demo-sales call is a conversation designed to get prospects interested in your solution — and eager to involve other stakeholders on their buying team.\n\nFinally, your research should give you a list of important questions to ask. Having these ready is key to engaging your prospects and ensuring you fully understand what they want from your product.\n\n## Follow up with async materials for decision-makers\n\nDelivering your demo is just the start of a new conversation. [According to Gong](https://www.gong.io/blog/sales-demos/), successful product demos devote significantly more time to discussing next steps. Be sure to agree on these with your prospect, and set a date for when to connect next. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1662042253/blog/product-demos-pls/Inline_image_product-demos-pls_w1200_-1.png] [alt:A screenshot zoom-in towards a sharing pop-up for a demo slide deck. The arrow is hovering over the custom, public URL that says: pitch.com/public/demodeck.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nA [recent LinkedIn report](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/b2b-sales-strategy-guides/the-state-of-sales-2022-uk-edition) found that the number of stakeholders involved in the average B2B purchasing decision has climbed to a record high of 13 people. This means that a lot of your communication with the buying team will come down to empowering your champion and [selling async](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-sell-async-with-pitch). Share a leave-behind version of your demo deck that includes agreements from your call, along with answers to any outstanding questions and additional information on features that resonated.\n\nConsider adding a recording of yourself presenting, so stakeholders who weren't able to attend the demo can watch it async.\n\n## A living, breathing product demo\n\nOver the past few years, the buyer’s journey for SaaS products has changed significantly, and the role of the product demo and accompanying presentations have evolved with it. Here’s a quick recap:\n\n* Make a modular demo deck.\n* Use research to tailor your demo.\n* Deliver your demo at the right altitude.\n* Follow up with async materials for decision-makers. \n\nA final note: Keep testing to continuously iterate and improve on your demo. When no two prospects’ product familiarity is the same, every demo call is an opportunity to try a new variation — and ask a new question.\n\nHow are you rising to the challenge of supporting an increasingly product-led buyer’s journey?

Today’s buyers can pick from a variety of options, expect to get information instantly, and make [buying decisions asynchronously](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-sell-async-with-pitch). That means sales meetings are as much about handling objections and building rapport as they are about showcasing a solution. \n\nWe’ll look at some best practices for presenting in sales meetings, so you can deliver an engaging pitch and leave space for important conversations. Plus, we’ll show how Pitch helps you foster and standardize this behavior across your salesforce.\n\n## The best setup for screen-sharing\n\nInvesting some time into the right setup sets the foundation for successful sales meetings. Do you need a second monitor? Where should each meeting participant look while presenting? And what’s the smoothest way to switch between a sales deck and a live demo? Here’s what you need to know.\n\n### Single- vs. multi-screen\n\nWhen it comes to professional screen-sharing, a dual-screen setup is the way to go. More desktop space equals more context and flexibility. Use one screen for anything you share with the prospect, whether it’s your slides or a live product demo. Use the other as your personal space for speaker notes, CRM records, sales collateral, and more.\n\nIf having two screens isn’t feasible, a single-screen setup can also work. Open multiple windows on your desktop — for example, the Pitch app and your browser — and share just the presentation window on your video call. That way, you can still easily read your speaker notes while you’re presenting.\n\n### Using speaker view\n\nWhen presenting slides on a sales call, use a setup that helps you focus on your delivery. First off, your audience should always see the whole slide without any additional clutter that could distract from your pitch. In Pitch, simply [play your presentation](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5335224-view-presentations) before sharing your screen. The next step depends on how familiar you are with your content.\n\nKnow your pitch inside out? Simply playing a presentation and sharing this window will likely do the trick for you. Then, hide controls for a distraction-free view of your deck. \n\nMore likely, though, you’ll benefit from some extra support. With speaker notes, time management tools, and all your slides at your fingertips, you’ll instantly feel more confident while presenting. Meanwhile, the prospect will see a full-screen version of the deck. If you’re not currently using speaker view, making it part of your routine may be the fastest way to level up your sales presentation skills.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1661246544/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-open-speaker-view.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1661267787/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-open-speaker-view-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Juggling screenshares\n\nAnother aspect of your setup is switching between the different windows you’re sharing. If you’re selling a product during your call, you’re probably not showing your slides from beginning to end. Instead, you might present some slides, dive into a live demo, and pull up additional resources based on how the conversation unfolds.\n\nMost video conference tools allow you to switch seamlessly between different windows while screen-sharing. Your prospects can see a full-screen view of what you’re talking about instead of getting an unwanted glimpse of your vacation research tabs. Make sure you prepare relevant windows ahead of the call (and close any unnecessary ones), so you can quickly find them in the midst of the action.\n\n## Your presenting style, your speaker view\n\nThe ideal speaker view has just the right amount of information. With Pitch, you can [customize the layout of your speaker view](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4056889-present-using-speaker-view) to show only what you need.\n\n### Navigate slides\n\nPreview the next slide to keep your speech flowing. And if a customer has a question about a previous point at the end of the presentation, you can quickly jump to that slide.\n\n### View and take notes\n\nSupport your pitch with talking points, additional facts, or helpful prompts. You can even jot down quick notes whenever the prospect shares relevant details with you.\n\n### Manage your time\n\nShow a timer, clock, or progress bar to keep track of time. That way, you’ll be able to make your points, leave space to handle any objections the prospect may have, and agree on next steps to move the deal forward.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1661246547/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-customize-speaker-view.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1661267787/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-customize-speaker-view-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOnce you’ve picked your speaker view settings, Pitch will automatically remember them for the next time.\n\n## Speaker notes — your hidden superpower\n\nSpeaker notes are an often overlooked part of a sales rep’s toolkit. But, when used right, they can be a true confidence booster and help keep the call on track, even when the unexpected happens.\n\n### Know your key messages\n\nA well-crafted sentence can help you make your point in a clear, concise way. But the right words aren’t always available on demand. Prepare a couple of sentences you can use to eloquently relay your main ideas — and avoid wading into sensitive legal territory.\n\nAt the same time, don’t script your entire pitch. You still want to come across naturally and be able to respond to your prospects’ questions or nonverbal cues.\n\n### Get the facts straight\n\nInclude easy-to-forget details in your speaker notes — like the source of a stat on a slide or answers to frequently asked questions. This way, your slides look clean, and you have additional information on hand when you need it.\n\n### Engage with prospects\n\nDialogues sell — monologues don’t. So remind yourself to interact with the prospect throughout the call. Say your next slide is about the different integrations your product offers. Instead of giving it all away, you could ask what their software stack looks like and then use the answer to segue into the next slide. This way, you’re leveling with the prospect and telling a story together.\n\n### Personalize your pitch on the spot\n\nNot every section within a presentation is equally relevant to every prospect. Speaker notes can help you focus on what matters most. For instance, you could include a prompt in your notes to ask if the prospect has used a similar product before. If they have, skip the slides explaining your category and navigate to the slides about what differentiates your solution.\n\n### Take notes for future reference\n\nThere are great tools available for note-taking. But switching between apps makes it hard to focus on your delivery. In Pitch, you can edit the speaker notes to jot down thoughts for future reference, like technical questions you promised to answer in a follow-up email.\n\n## Templatize your speaker notes\n\nDuplicating decks and copying over speaker notes every time you pitch to a new prospect is time-consuming and error-prone. With this copy-and-paste approach, achieving consistent sales excellence is impossible, especially if your product or service is evolving quickly or you’re personalizing presentations to individual customers.\n\nInstead, create a template from a sales deck you’d like to keep reusing, so everyone can access the most up-to-date version. Templates ensure that your deck’s structure and style are consistent — and you can include speaker notes to help everyone stay on message.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1661246546/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-templatize-speaker-notes.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1661267787/blog/How%20to%20deliver%20the%20perfect%20sales%20pitch/sales-templatize-speaker-notes-still.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMarketing or sales enablement teams can help sales reps move faster by providing presentation templates with speaker notes. Maintaining templates in your Pitch workspace means that sales reps have the latest version of slides and speaker notes whenever they create a new deck. This is also an excellent opportunity to incorporate new insights about what resonates with prospects (and what doesn’t) and continuously improve the quality of sales calls in your company.\n\n## Summing it up\n\nWith a little prep, you can make every sales call run smoothly and leave prospects excited to keep the ball rolling. Start with a setup that suits your presenting style, and support your pitch with speaker notes. Take it one step further with presentation templates that set everyone on your sales team up for success. \n\nLooking for a quick way to showcase your product or service?

It allows founders to complete milestones and log their hours. Our app calculates a split that’s fair for companies and employees. \n\nThere are currently 300 million founders around the world working on 150 million businesses. Our goal is to help early-stage founders organize an essential part of building a startup: Handling equity. \n\n### What’s your founder story? \n\n**Naïma:** As a founder, one of the most important decisions you’ll ever make is who you choose to found your company with. I met my co-founder Dom when we were working at an innovation center that helped startups scale. We came together at the start of the pandemic to create a solution that was very different to what Ownership is today. \n\nWe got to where we are now by slowly iterating and learning more about the problem. The biggest lesson for me was that starting is the most important step. Once you take that step, you gain momentum and your progress slowly accumulates into something worthwhile. \n\nWe launched Ownership in Q3 of 2021. And surprisingly, most of our learning happened after we launched. Our focus over the last six months has been building the foundation to scale beyond the app. \n\n### Why did you decide on an app? \n\n**Naïma:** We knew early-stage founders were underserved — and when we interviewed founders, the issue of equity came up again and again. We quickly learned that equity was the main way of getting people to work on your idea when you don't have cash. But existing equity solutions target later stage businesses who have already raised investment and been able to hire employees. \n\n### Any key milestones and tips on how you achieved them?\n\n**Naïma:** So far, our app has several hundred users, and our month-on-month growth rate is 25%. \n\nMy biggest tip is to find organizations you can learn from and that can help elevate you — people who believe in your mission and enable you to flourish. We’ve also got a great support system of other founders who are either a few steps ahead or at the same stage as us. Everyone is happy to share their perspectives and offer help. Having a co-founder you trust also goes a long way.\n\nYou come from a policy research background and have covered fast-moving industries like the startup world, VR, and Blockchain. What made you decide to take the leap and become a founder? \n\nWhen I was researching and interviewing startups, I always came away inspired — especially in the emerging tech space because a lot of it is still speculative. The founders I spoke to were imagining a brand-new world that didn’t exist yet. Speaking to them made me realize it was a leap I eventually wanted to make myself. Most didn’t have all the answers but were trying anyway, which made the founder journey seem more accessible. \n\n### What are some of the challenges you've faced going from a salaried job to being your own boss?\n\n**Naïma:** I had a steep learning curve when it came to creating our own company structure and processes. As founders, we have to work out the top priorities for our business, and that’s really difficult to do pre-product or pre-team. You’re constantly making decisions with a blank slate. \n\nIt’s also tough to completely switch off. I struggle with that in general, but it’s even more difficult as a founder because there’s always more to do. \n\nAnd I’m learning how to hire the right people. Every new hire will have a huge influence on the company culture, so we’re having to simultaneously work out what kind of culture we want to create!\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/902d7de2-5350-44d4-b458-0974b5331fb9\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### What was your fundraising strategy? \n\n**Naïma:** Our fundraising planning began 3–6 months before we actually jumped in. It’s really useful to start conversations with investors before you need money from them — which is why we were always on investor calls, even when we had very little traction. We discovered they were a lot more transparent when there wasn’t added pressure to make a decision then and there. \n\nHere’s a list of the things we did before we started speaking to investors: \n\n* Drafted outreach emails\n* Created specific objectives for the fundraising round\n* Identified investors and angels using Crunchbase\n* Posted on social media\n* Prepared a financial model\n* Created a press pack\n* Prepared [a pitch deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Ownership-App-Pitch-Deck--4JqnyH6wQRNy5PCV6W6pJrUn?slide=dcb41f31-0397-419b-a07d-e0c46c86483a), data room, and one-pager\n\n### How did you find your investors?\n\n**Naïma:** We made most of our investor connections through introductions. The industry is changing, but introductions are still key. Every time we spoke to someone, we’d end the call by asking, “Who should we be speaking with?” Afterward, we’d follow up to remind them. \n\nI didn’t realize how little of fundraising is actually spent on calls with investors. The majority of it is spent following up, providing more information, and chasing a response. Investors want to see you run just as much as they want to get to know the team.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"I didn’t realize how little of fundraising is actually spent on calls with investors. The majority of it is spent following up.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs we moved further into the fundraising round, it became less about outreach and more about managing relationships with the investors we met. We had to figure out what we wanted the final makeup to look like in terms of the percentage of angels versus VCs. \n\n### Tell us how you crafted your pitch. Was it an iterative process or something you practiced and polished before going public?\n\n**Naïma:** It was very iterative. I’m lucky that my co-founder is a designer because we’d have brainstorming sessions, and then he’d design the outcome. Afterward, we’d get feedback and make edits. We used demo days as an opportunity to practice our pitch and gain confidence. We even started over from scratch a few times — after getting the same questions from different investors, it was clear we were missing some key points. \n\nThese points were mainly about how the product worked. We ended up adding a huge, detailed appendix at the end of our deck to explain how it functioned. This meant we could have a more substantive conversation from the get-go. \n\n### Based on your experience, do you have any tips for other founders to succeed in pitching?\n\n**Naïma:** My main tip is to start the fundraising process before you actually need to — and to practice pitching with investors who aren’t your top picks. Also, follow up after every call and get feedback. I like to ask investors questions like, “What are the strongest parts of my business?” and “What are the areas that really need work?” You can even ask these questions during a call, especially if you haven’t yet started fundraising. \n\nPractice pitching with people outside of tech to distill your pitch down to the simplest language possible. I always practice with my mom and sister to see if I'm using too many buzzwords that detract from the problem we’re trying to solve. \n\n- - -\n\nThis was the first part of our Founder Q\u0026A series.

In reality, there was an async component all along — and it’s usually the weakest point in the sales cycle.\n\nMost of the buyer’s decision-making process happens when your company rep is not in the (physical or virtual) room. Your champion at the prospect might reference the materials you’ve shared with them through the sales process and use them to pitch your solution to internal stakeholders. But the problem with most sales collateral is that it’s designed to support someone presenting in person, not to work standalone. As soon as the customer is on their own, information can quickly get lost or misunderstood, putting the deal at risk.\n\nSo, how can you influence the sales process asynchronously? Sales teams need to deliver a compelling pitch that can be consumed anytime and keep a pulse on how prospects interact with their content. Pitch can help you do just that — without juggling multiple tools.\n\n## Create a deck that can pitch itself\n\nSlide decks are great a visual aid when pitching your solution to a prospect. [Research tells us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201207/learning-through-visuals \"https\\://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201207/learning-through-visuals\") that visual cues not only help us get our message across in the first place, but prospects will also recall information more easily after the call.\n\nBut even the best slide deck isn’t nearly as effective without in-person narration. It lacks context, expression, and personal connection. A detailed written proposal may seem like a good way to convey the full context, but most decision-makers will only skim it if they read it at all. Of course, you could also use separate software to record a video of your pitch. But for prospects, a long video is just as intimidating as a wall of text. And a single mistake could force you to re-record the whole thing.\n\nWith Pitch, you can [add recordings directly to your slides](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) to create more engaging, context-rich sales decks. No need to combine different tools! Messages can be consistently delivered no matter where your deck travels, putting less pressure on the champion to convey your narrative. You can add narration to entire decks, but even a single personalized video message on the cover slide can go a long way.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1656604393/blog/async_sales-recordings.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656683847/blog/async_sales-recordings-img.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe built recordings in a way that helps you perfect your pitch faster and sell more effectively:\n\n* **Record as many takes as you need.** You don’t have to start over from the beginning until you nail your delivery. Just go to a slide and record another take. And unlike with other recording tools, you can continue to polish your slides after adding a recording.\n* **Present together to seal the deal.** You can easily switch speaking roles when collaborating on a deck. Why not let an engineer cover a technical subject or even include a customer testimonial?\n\nOnce you’re happy with your deck, just share a link with your prospects for easy playback on any device. No matter when and where stakeholders view your deck, they’ll always get the full story.\n\n## Stay in control of your shared deck\n\nAttaching a document to an email is a missed opportunity, and the lack of interactivity and context isn’t the only reason.\n\nMaybe you’ve replaced in-person touchpoints with async ones for all or some prospects, based on funnel stage, buyer persona, time zone, company size, deal volume, or the buyer’s communication preferences. Or maybe you’re sharing a deck after a demo call, so the champion can distribute it to other decision-makers within their company.\n\nOf course, you want to know if the deck you’re sharing is making an impact. And you definitely don’t want to sweat over a nasty typo … or the wrong company logo. If you’re using separate document sharing and analytics tools, you may have experienced the hassle of juggling all the links, especially if you need to change content later on.\n\nWith Pitch, you can refresh your content even after sharing a link to your deck. Learned something about the prospect’s needs during a call or email with the champion? Simply edit the deck to keep it relevant. Plus, you’re getting insight into when, where, and how often it was viewed. All this is baked into the core experience, so you don’t need to combine multiple tools.\n\nYou can create multiple short URLs for any presentation. Instead of duplicating your sales deck or sharing a one public link with everyone, use one per prospect and analyze each link separately. With [Pitch for iOS and Android](https://pitch.com/download \"https\\://pitch.com/download\"), you can even create custom links when writing prospects on the go.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1656604392/blog/async_sales-analytics.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656683847/blog/async-analytics-img.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSharing custom links gives you insights that can help you optimize your presentation and tailor your sales activities. For example, you can use presentation analytics to identify engaged prospects: If you’re dealing with a high volume of deals, it’s all about how you spend your time. Focus on prospects who’ve expressed genuine interest by visiting your decks. Or tailor your follow-up based on how engaged a prospect is.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning. [Presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics \"https\\://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics\") is a key pillar of our product vision and will keep getting more powerful.\n\n## Save time by starting with a template\n\nWe designed the Async Sales Deck to help you confidently pitch your product or service to prospects, whenever and wherever they watch your presentation. This template comes with space for recordings, so you can easily add videos to your slide. Ready to share a deck that can pitch itself?

We’ll walk you through how to go from blank slate to polished deck, and provide the tips and resources you’ll need to turn your board reports into a significant business advantage.\n\n## What is a board report?\n\nA board report is a set of pre-read materials prepared by an organization’s executive team at regular intervals. The report includes important updates and an agenda for an upcoming board meeting. It’s usually sent ahead of time so that the board can use the meeting for productive discussions. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_animatedbackground.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_animatedbackground.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhile a board report can be compiled in various formats, a presentation is commonly used so contributors can include text, images, and charts.\n\n## What are board reports for?\n\nA board is [the governing body of a company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) or [nonprofit](https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/why-do-you-need-a-board), and it exists [to offer both advice and oversight](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication-pdf/cgri-quick-guide-03-board-directors-duties-liabilities.pdf). According to a [2020 study by Harvard Business School and Russell Reynolds](https://hbr.org/2020/02/top-boards-do-these-4-things-differently), the most effective boards at high-performing companies (also known as “Gold Medal Boards“) demonstrate the ability to “refocus the board agenda.“ This is essentially what your board report is for: to help your board members perform their job more effectively by focusing on what matters most.\n\nBefore you start putting together your board report, keep these three objectives in mind:\n\n### 1. Board reports should **inform**\n\nBoard members will only be able to help companies achieve their goals if they have a good grasp of the organization. To this end, the board report should provide all the essential information required to keep board members up-to-date about performance, progress, opportunities, and challenges.\n\n### 2. Board reports should drive decision-making\n\nAn effective board report raises and frames the decisions that need to be made, and provides all the background required to help board members make the choices that drive an organization toward its goals. It lays the foundation for robust conversations and exchanges of diverse perspectives so that the meeting leads to better decisions for the business.\n\n### 3. Board reports should create accountability\n\nThe board represents the interests of shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders in the organization. All senior executives are ultimately accountable to the board, which even has the authority to hire and fire executives — including the CEO. Board reports therefore serve as a key piece of documentation to drive accountability between these two groups. Board materials should provide transparency and visibility into the organization's activities, so the board can hold executives accountable for management performance.\n\n## How to structure your board deck\n\nA [2022 McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/five-ways-to-increase-your-boards-long-term-impact) of board directors and executives revealed that despite spending 19% more time on board work since 2019, board members haven’t delivered a greater impact on value creation overall. Creating a well-structured [board deck](https://pitch.com/use-cases/board-decks) is the key to generating maximum board impact without requiring any additional time commitment from board members.\n\nHere are the five essential sections you should have in your board deck:\n\n### 1. Big picture\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679653740/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/big-picture-slide.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Meeting-2J5xoJ4yV9Bw4vTmZ50A8hUF] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Meeting-2J5xoJ4yV9Bw4vTmZ50A8hUF] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis is your TL;DR section — the first one or two slides that your board members will focus on in your report. Use it to tell the high-level story of how things are going, where you need support or advice, and which important decisions, if any, need to be made. \n\nTypically, this section includes: \n\n* A bullet-point overview of the information in the rest of the deck (often called the “executive summary” or “CEO update”)\n* A summary of recent performance, which can be broken up into highlights and lowlights\n* An agenda for the board meeting\n\n“An executive summary at the start of the report is key,” says [David Larcker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-larcker-a776986/), Professor Emeritus at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the author of [Corporate Governance Matters](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/corporate-governance-matters-closer-look-organizational-choices) and [A Real Look at Real World Corporate Governance](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/real-look-real-world-corporate-governance). “List the important decisions you want to address in the meeting, and reference where in the report these will be covered. I find it strange when business and financials aren’t covered early on. Don’t wait to deal with the hard stuff until later in the meeting.”\n\n**Tip:** Finalize this section last. You’ll only be able to create the best summary of all the content in your deck once you’re done assembling the rest of your report. \n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nAn executive summary at the start of the report is key. List the important decisions you want to address in the meeting, and reference where in the report these will be covered.] \\[cta-label:] \\[cta-href:] \\[photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679654593/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/david-larcker.jpg] \\[name:David Larcker] \\[role:Professor Emeritus at Stanford Graduate School of Business] \\[company-logo:] \\[layout:small] \\[variant:]  \\[spacingTop:true] \\[spacingBottom:true] \\[spacingSize:small]}}.  \n\n### 2. Key metrics\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679653738/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/key-metrics-slide.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-5WNEjL4zD9815VDStw4Vt6SS] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-5WNEjL4zD9815VDStw4Vt6SS] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nGet your charts and tables ready — in this section, the numbers do the talking. The key metrics you report on should be ones you’ve previously identified and agreed upon with your board.\n\nThese might not all be financial metrics like revenue growth, cash burn, or average deal size. Depending on your organization’s strategy, there may be other metrics that better reflect how things are going — for instance, new user signups, hiring rate, product data, or patent applications. And if there’s any manual work involved in pulling the data, be sure to plan around this.\n\n**Tip:** Make the metrics easily digestible by writing slide headers that distill the main messages and pairing them with a high-level commentary. This text should give your board a good picture of recent performance without close scrutiny of your charts. Consider using color-coding or icons to highlight areas of success (green/check) or risk (red/cross/exclamation point).\n\n### 3. Company updates\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679653738/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/company-updates-slide.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-6PvXF86kj3Zp4WtnRs46zfG7] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-6PvXF86kj3Zp4WtnRs46zfG7] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s time to move beyond the numbers and tell the story of how — and where — things are going. While metrics tend to put the focus on the past, this section allows you to look at leading rather than lagging indicators, and get advice on future initiatives.\n\nInclude an update on recent or planned hiring, current team size and morale, product roadmap and updates, upcoming feature launches, marketing campaigns, and other plans for needle-moving programs. You can also include any financial metrics not highlighted in the previous section.\n\n**Tip:** Be completely transparent about how things are going. Startup founders often struggle with the transition from [pitching their groundbreaking idea](https://pitch.com/blog/steps-to-delivering-a-standout-pitch) to acknowledging where their plans fall short. Recognize this shift and focus on building trust with your board, so they can help you address any blockers you’re facing. \n\n### 4. Focus topics\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1679653738/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/focus-topics-slide.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Report-0QiA5y4qZK7K5hSqVS6uRLhv] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Report-0QiA5y4qZK7K5hSqVS6uRLhv] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNow that you’ve covered all the headlines, get ready to dive into your focus topics. This section is your chance to steer the board’s attention toward points that require further discussion. \n\nMaybe there’s an area where the organization is struggling, and you want help. Or conversely, an opportunity is presenting itself and you’re wondering how to make the most of it. To keep things focused and manageable, include just one or two of these topics in your report. \n\n“Depth before breadth,” says [Katharina Wilhelm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathiwilhelm/), a Partner at [Index Ventures](https://www.indexventures.com/). “In the best board meetings, everyone has already had a chance to read through the business update beforehand, and you can focus on the 1–2 strategically most important topics where a collective discussion is key.”\n\nRather than simply listing the topics to discuss, provide context that can inform the discussion. Anticipate the board’s potential questions, and gather as much information as you can to answer them. \n\nNeed an introduction from your board's network or want to have follow-up meetings with specific board members? If you have ideas of how your board can help, state your request for support here — including clear owners and timelines.\n\n**Tip:** To know which topics to prioritize, make a list of every issue on your (and your team’s) mind. Create a 2x2 matrix with axes reflecting the topic's urgency and its impact on your organization's mission. Plot each topic on the matrix, and prioritize those that score high for impact and urgency.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nIn the best board meetings, everyone has read through the business update beforehand, and you can focus on the 1–2 strategically most important topics where a collective discussion is key.] \\[cta-label:] \\[cta-href:] \\[photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1681283963/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/1644266486454.jpg] \\[name:Katharina Wilhelm] \\[role:Partner at Index Ventures] \\[company-logo:] \\[layout:small] \\[variant:]  \\[spacingTop:true] \\[spacingBottom:true] \\[spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 5.

Typically, there’s no need to prepare extra slides or talking points here — these should emerge organically during the meeting. \n\nOne thing you can do is add a blank slide where board members can jot down questions and comments prior to the meeting. It’s also a good idea to include a slide for action items, which can be reviewed in the next board meeting.\n\n**Tip:** It’s common for non-board members to skip the Q\u0026A, leaving only the board members and CEO or founders. This allows the group to freely discuss the most sensitive topics.\n\nNow that you know how to structure your board report, let’s look at a few actionable tips that’ll help you optimize the success of your meeting.\n\n## 10 essential tips for successful board meetings \n\n### 1. Keep your presentation short and action-focused\n\nBoard decks should highlight important topics that drive decision-making and action. To do that, you need to cut through the noise and get the board to focus on what matters most. Indicate which slides or sections are more for informational purposes by using standardized “read-only“ labels.\n\n### 2. Keep the group small\n\nWhile it's important to seek out diverse opinions, having too many people present in board meetings can make the conversation unwieldy and unfocused. Consider who really needs to be there. If someone’s input matters for a single phase of the meeting, you can save everyone time by inviting them to join just that one section.\n\n### 3. Ask yourself, “So what?” \n\n[A study in Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/09/make-time-for-the-work-that-matters) found that knowledge workers spend about 41% of their time doing things they don't enjoy, or that someone else could do better. The same can probably be said for topics covered in board reports. Those handful of hours per quarter when you have your board’s full attention are precious — so ask yourself which discussions will truly move the needle, and zero in on those.\n\n### 4. Ask the board for help, and track action items\n\nYour board is there to support you, but they may not have as much information to work with as you do. Help them help you by including a clear set of requests in your board report. During the meeting, make a list of action items and assign responsibilities. Be sure to follow up afterward by appointing one team member to track requests and action items.\n\n### 5. Share the deck ahead of time \n\nShare your board report at least 48 hours before the meeting. Public or larger company board reports are typically sent out for review at least two weeks ahead of a board meeting. This gives board members time to review the content and agenda beforehand, so the meeting’s focus can be on discussion rather than information-sharing. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653925822/use-case/create-better-board-decks/SalesDeckDashboard.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEncourage your board members to [drop comments directly into your deck](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments) so that everyone involved can prepare for the discussions. If you’re a [Pitch Pro](https://pitch.com/pro) user, you can even [see which board members have viewed the deck](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5592127-view-presentation-analytics) to get a sense of how to best steer the meeting.\n\n### 6. Appoint a timekeeper \n\nOn your agenda slide, allocate a specific amount of time for each section of the report. This’ll help you use your time efficiently and avoid unproductive discussions. If the chairperson of your board isn’t doing it themselves, assign a timekeeper to keep the meeting on track. That way, other attendees can focus on participating in the discussion, taking notes, and voting on decisions.\n\n### 7. Enlist your team in deck-building \n\nIt’s unlikely that you’ll have all the information you need to build the board deck by yourself. [Collaborate with your team by assigning slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) to the people closest to a specific topic. Then keep track of what’s completed, and what’s still a work in progress.\n\n### 8. Encourage the entire board to participate\n\n[Mandates for board diversity](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/board-diversity-laws) are becoming more common. [Studies have shown](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication-pdf/qg-diverseboards.pdf) that boards that collectively represent diverse lived experiences are more effective at steering organizations. But board diversity is only a benefit if all members contribute. You can help everyone participate by asking quieter members for their perspectives on focused topics, and encouraging all members to speak up during meetings.\n\n### 9. Keep the information accessible\n\nIf your business operates in a technically complex or acronym-heavy industry, consider adding an acronym reference resource in the appendix of your deck. This can also be useful if you measure your business using specialized or less commonly used metrics. Include clear definitions for each metric, which your board can refer to as needed.\n\n### 10. Collect feedback\n\n[Board evaluation](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/10/26/effective-board-evaluation/) is a hot topic for public companies. But even early-stage startups can take inspiration from these more formal processes, and integrate feedback rounds into their board reports and board meeting cadence. \n\nAt the end of your board meeting, conduct a lightning feedback round where every participant has a chance to name one thing that went well and one that could be improved. Alternatively, you can also send a quick post-meeting survey to collect suggestions on how to improve materials or processes. Then, iterate on your approach to make your next board report and meeting even better.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1681287628/blog/How%20to%20write%20a%20board%20report/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-board-reports.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/presentations/How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-board-meetings-62GMRP6cV5cQ4Jr6NN2NUNYq] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:View this deck] [href:https://pitch.com/presentations/How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-board-meetings-62GMRP6cV5cQ4Jr6NN2NUNYq] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Elevate your next board report with custom templates\n\nReady to start collaborating with your team on your next board report? Save time by using one of Pitch’s tailor-made board report templates, which you can easily adapt to your company’s brand.

We often get asked how we go about building decks ourselves, so we wanted to share how we built a particularly important presentation: the pitch deck behind our $85M Series B.\n\nFounders abound in the Pitch community, so it’s only natural that fundraising is often top-of-mind. We’re no exception: As a growing startup, we’re familiar with the fundraising process and its challenges firsthand. Earlier this year, we completed our own Series B funding, [raising $85 million in a round led by Lakestar and Tiger Global](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-series-b-funding). \n\nIn the spirit of sharing our experiences with other founders, we want to take you behind the scenes, and show you how we created the deck we used to raise the round. We’ll look at the process we used to craft the narrative, share the ways we used Pitch together with other tools to collaborate, and highlight some of our top learnings.\n\n## Step 1: Kicking off pre-deck prep work\n\nOne of the most critical steps of building our Series B pitch deck came before we ever started a slide. \n\nWe see the fundraising process as an opportunity for us to pick our heads up from the day-to-day routine, reflect on the direction the world's moving in, and ask ourselves how we see Pitch fitting in as part of this bigger picture.\n\nSo, rather than starting with the slides themselves, we kicked the process off with a workshop with our leadership and product teams. \n\nThe goal of this workshop was to outline the high-level story we wanted to tell. While we already had a clear product roadmap and validated value propositions, we didn't want to limit ourselves to the here and now. \n\nWe saw this as a chance to take a step back and give our designers the chance to engage in ambitious, aspirational explorations of where we might take Pitch next. Not only did this workshop process give us the clarity we needed to start working on the actual pitch deck with confidence, it renewed our team’s creative energy to tackle what’s ahead and reminded us what we’re working toward.\n\n## Step 2: Creating the deck itself\n\nThe next step was to start crafting the presentation itself. As we set out to create our pitch deck, we wanted to find synthesis between our newly articulated narrative and the latest indicators we had on the health, growth, and evolution of our business. \n\nWe started by forming a working group with leads drawn from product, design, and marketing. Captained by our CEO Christian Reber, this group worked to begin building a draft deck that Christian could test-drive with existing investors, partners, and advisors in his network.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1630057108/blog/HowPitchcreates_Slack-convo.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nChristian returned with feedback on what was sticking, what needed more work, and what should be cut, and the team was able to make revisions in real time. By following this parallel process — aligning product and business on the one hand, and integrating live feedback on the other — we were able to continuously refine and improve our deck.\n\n## Step 3: Getting the pitch deck ready for primetime\n\nWith a road-tested set of slides, a clear product vision, and a view of our business opportunity all in hand, we had all we needed to kick off the fundraising process. But before we did, there was one final, critical step we took: determining what belonged in the central story we wanted to tell, and what could be shared separately for additional context.\n\nThe reality of fundraising these days is that it's a semi-asynchronous process. Rarely, if ever, do founders enter a room (or a Zoom) without having shared presentation materials in advance for review. So how do you handle the fact that you're going to talk through materials that have already been read (at least partially)?\n\nThe way we did that was by cutting our deck in two.\n\n[Our main deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Series-B-pitch-deck-55EVgG5xwWBf4QTimp4asXQk) was intended for presentation, and included slides that would be part of the pitch itself. This included slides showing our company story, our product vision, and our most promising growth opportunities. Even if investors look at them in advance, these kinds of slides work their magic when brought to life with a strong story in a meeting.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/36ca89e1-293c-4779-8f2a-7ad427d7fe87?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThen, we prepared a separate data deck with all the business fundamentals that were critical for assessing the investment opportunity with Pitch. This deck was denser, created with the goal of being informative, and didn't require an in-person narration to be effectively consumed.\n\nWhen the time came to share our deck with investors, we created a dedicated folder for each investor we spoke with. That way, when we met, it was easy to direct attention to the deck with our story, and focus the conversation on what mattered.\n\nBy utilizing shared folders in this way, the process was closer to an ongoing conversation than a one-way PDF attachment. If investors had follow-up questions about the team, product data, or anything else, they were able to ask them directly in the deck using comments. And if more information was needed, we were able to add additional presentations to the shared folders to give them extra context or data.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1630421489/blog/1_HowPitchCreates_folders_w1200.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## The tools we used\n\nWhile Pitch was the main tool we used, it definitely wasn’t the only one. We leaned heavily on some of our other favorite tools to help us collaborate and communicate most effectively. These tools were important throughout the process, but especially in the initial stages, before we had begun building the deck itself.\n\n* **Notion** helped set our objectives and our process for our early thinking sessions and workshops. We created a Notion page with some background on why we want to create a new pitch deck. In addition to main objectives, we also documented the core working team and high-level timing that would enable us to deliver an initial version of the draft in time for our leadership offsite. \n* **Figma** was where we did our visual explorations. Our product designers were able to work in Figma and then upload the finished assets to Pitch. \n* **Slack** was where we discussed, debated, and aligned on our product vision in the early stages, and later where we communicated about the deck itself. We opened a Slack channel for our core working group to centralize all the important conversations around the production of the pitch deck and used a combination of Slack and Pitch to assign slides and share updates with the team. \n\nWhen it came to the actual deck creation, the majority of the work naturally took place in Pitch. We made sure the deck was in our main company workspace, so more people could organically join the process by seeing the work in progress. \n\nDuring the revision stages, Pitch’s strength as a collaboration tool really shone. Because multiple people could work on a slide at once, marketing wrote copy while product designers added in assets, with everyone confident that they were working on the most up-to-date version of the deck. We relied on comments and slide statuses to clarify progress, share feedback, and mention people for specific requests. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1630055916/blog/Editor_Pitchdeck_Workflow_3.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1630421489/blog/1_HowPitchCreates_folders_w1200.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## What we learned\n\n1. **The process of building a pitch deck should be a natural extension of the way we work together.** For us, this meant that stopping, reflecting, and realigning around our product vision was an essential first step as we prepared to speak with investors.\n2. **Pitch decks are an expression of our vision, not an all-inclusive report.** One of the ways we see pitch decks changing in our newly asynchronous world is that they have become more multi-dimensional. We created a central story, and built on top of that with personalized follow-up decks that enhanced our core vision with more information.\n3. **Creating a pitch deck doesn't need to happen sequentially, or in a vacuum.** A live, iterative process helped us move forward with confidence. Working in Pitch gave Christian a chance to test out individual slides and concepts during impromptu conversations with his network. He was then able to share feedback on what worked particularly well so we could fine-tune it.\n\nIn our view, pitch decks are about more than just convincing investors, they’re a chance to align everyone in the company and leadership team around your vision. \n\nDon’t just take it from us: For companies like [Pento](https://pitch.com/blog/how-pento-raised-15-6m-with-pitch) and [Yac](https://pitch.com/blog/how-yac-raised-7-5-million-using-pitch), Pitch has proven itself as the platform of choice for building and sharing successful pitch decks.

Not only did they win the hackathon, but they went on to raise a total of $9M to bring audio-first, keyboard-free messaging to the world. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/yac_product_2.jpg] [alt:Yac voice messaging] [caption:Yac is revolutionizing the way modern teams communicate] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Going beyond “good enough” Google Slides\n\nAt a time when work is increasingly happening over a keyboard and not face to face, Yac is poised to become a key player in the modern team’s communication stack. Since COVID-19, they’ve seen a 400% increase in users and are well on their way to developing one of the most efficient audio communication platforms for remote work teams.\n\nWhen Yac was ready to raise its Series A, they originally started working on their pitch deck in Google Slides. After all, it had worked well enough for their initial raise. Google Slides was good enough.\n\nJustin Mitchell, Yac’s co-founder and CEO, is no stranger to the world of deck design. In his previous company, he had plenty of experience scrambling to build down-to-the-wire client [pitch decks](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks) using clunky software that wasn’t designed to meet his needs.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Yac_founders.jpg] [alt:The Yac founding team] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“As creative director, I had to do all the presentations we would use to pitch major brands like Hilton, IKEA, and Facebook. We had to customize each pitch to fit the brand we were going after,” he explains. “But in the end, it always looked like crap. My team asked why I was always failing at this one simple task. I just hated it — I hated making decks in Google Slides.” \n\n## Making the switch to Pitch\n\nOne day, while browsing Twitter, Justin heard about a new app called Pitch and decided to try it out. He showed Pitch to CMO and co-founder Hunter McKinley, and it was love at first slide. \n\n“I played with Pitch for four or five minutes and I was sold,” Hunter says. “I realized that Pitch was designed for people like us. We were in the middle of working on our Series A deck, but I immediately switched from working in Google Slides to working in Pitch.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“As soon as I started playing with Pitch, I immediately switched from Google Slides.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNaturally, his team was a little skeptical. Why switch now? \n\n“I told them I don’t know how to describe it. It just looks better. It feels better. It’s so design-focused. I was able to recreate my entire pitch deck — and make it look at least 10 times better — in an hour or two.”   \n\nEven Justin, who was the one to share Pitch with his team, didn’t get it initially. How was Pitch different from Google Slides? \n\n“The magic moment for Justin was when he saw the pitch deck template and realized I hadn’t actually written it,” Hunter says. “My co-founder thought that I had done so much more because the template was rigorous and thorough. He saw all these facts, figures, and structure — and that was just the template text.” \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/18e7c854-dd40-49b2-ac1a-a7c557f2691c?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Templates, a blueprint for a better pitch deck \n\nEven with work underway, Hunter was able to draw inspiration from [Pitch’s gallery of custom-crafted templates. ](https://pitch.com/templates)\n\n“The templates, design-wise, are much better than anything I’ve seen anywhere, including Google Slides,” Hunter says. \n\n{{component:image[src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Yac_template.jpg] [alt:Pitch template gallery for pitch decks] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn the midst of building a [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks) it’s easy to get bogged down by the details of the content and design. [Pitch’s templates](https://pitch.com/templates) helped Yac focus on delivering an effective message and strong story on every slide. \n\n“With Pitch, we were able to focus on content instead of design. That’s something Google Slides is missing.” Hunter explains. “It’s one thing to have filler text. But it’s another thing to have advice on your slides — like defining your market size and why that’s important. It’s coaching you through creating [your pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks) and what it should look like.” \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“It’s super useful to have experts guiding you through a pitch deck.

You can imagine how much time and energy that saves, and how much it makes a difference from a financial standpoint.”\n\n## Working together in Pitch \n\nWhen you’re working on a pitch deck, time is of the essence. With Pitch, the Yac team could [easily collaborate on slides](https://pitch.com/use-cases/slideshow-maker) without the need for endless back and forth. \n\n“Before, when I was using Google Slides, I’d start by adding a couple of words to each slide, like *What is Yac?* or *Finances*, just to give the deck a high-level outline. Then I’d go to the notes section on every slide and type in a name to assign a slide,” Hunter says. \n\n“That’s why I really like slide assignments in Pitch. Now I have an easy way to assign slides to myself, to Justin, or to anyone else on the team and see exactly what everyone is working on.” \n\nWith slide statuses, the team could easily visualize their progress as they worked to perfect their deck. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Yac_status.jpg] [alt:Yac pitch deck slide statuses] [caption:Slide statuses helped Yac track progress as they worked] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“We went back and forth. Sometimes we’d mark things as done, and then when going through the full flow of the deck would realize that things needed to be moved around or added. So we were constantly changing statuses as we worked through the deck. Compare that with Google Slides — anytime you open a doc you basically have to start with a fresh pair of eyes and you never know which slides are done or which aren’t.”\n\n“I like that I can be looking at one slide and on the left-hand side I can see all the slides and see who it’s assigned to and what the status is.” \n\nAs Hunter starts seeing more green dots appear, it’s reassurance that all his team’s hard work is coming together. \n\n## Bringing life to a static pitch deck\n\nWith pitch decks, the delivery is just as important as the content itself. \n\n“I’m typically very anti-pitch deck. You’re not just investing in the product — you’re investing in the team. The magic is in talking to me,” Justin explains. \n\nWhen pitching investors, Justin typically does the talking and for him, sending a static deck over just wasn’t the same. Through a special collaboration with Pitch, Yac was able to embed voice messages into key slides, sharing personal greetings and customer testimonials to bring their product’s value to life. \n\n## From pitch deck to term sheet in just 4 weeks\n\nNot only was the process of making their pitch deck simpler and more efficient, the final product was also a success. In November, Yac started working on their pitch deck. In December, they’d already received a term sheet. In their latest round, the team raised $7.5M to fund Yac's future growth.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Voices"],"title":"How Yoko Spirig from Ledgy builds a pitch deck","date":"2022-06-28T13:34:16.519Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Athena Lam","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213951/blog/ledgy/Header_MOBILE_Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213951/blog/ledgy/Header_SMALL_Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213951/blog/ledgy/Header_MID_Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213952/blog/ledgy/Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig_w1920.png","image-description":"A portrait of Yoko Spirig, CEO and co-founder of Ledgy for for a Founder Q\u0026A blog post on how to build a pitch deck","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213951/blog/ledgy/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig.png","thumbnail-description":"A portrait of Yoko Spirig, CEO and co-founder of Ledgy for for a Founder Q\u0026A blog post on how to build a pitch deck","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655213952/blog/ledgy/Social_share_Pitch-Founder-QandA-Ledgy-Yoko-Spirig.png","meta-image-description":"A portrait of Yoko Spirig, CEO and co-founder of Ledgy for for a Founder Q\u0026A blog post on how to build a pitch deck","teaser-text":"In this interview, Yoko Spirig, CEO and Co-founder of Ledgy, shares her secrets to building a successful pitch deck, and offers tips and resources for founders looking to raise a new round of funding.

There are well-known fundraising guides, such as the Y Combinator Series A guide, that provide an extraordinary amount of value, and there are also valuable seed and growth-stage funding guides for founders. \n\nIt’s important to understand which investors focus on your sector and your company stage. If you’re raising seed funding for an e-commerce business, a growth-stage investor specializing in cybersecurity is unlikely to be a relevant prospect for you, great deck or not. It’s important to align your pitch with each investor and their investment thesis. \n\n### How did you craft your deck to appeal to investors?\n\nYoko: We were very clear about starting with our mission up front, articulating exactly why my co-founders and I founded a company together in the first place. We genuinely believe that entrepreneurs will be central to solving the world’s problems, and we want to help teams to create positive change in the world. (Incidentally, this is why sustainability is so important to us at Ledgy.)\n\nStarting with the ‘why’ lets you build the business case for the product, and create a logical narrative that investors can follow. In our case, it’s the fact that the European tech ecosystem is developing at a rapid pace, but there’s still no standard way to handle equity and share ownership. \n\n### What advice do you have for other founders when building a pitch deck, and who did you involve? \n\nYoko: First, look at what other founders have said about the process. There are personal and useful posts from great founders like Mathilde Collin, the CEO of Front and one of our angel investors. Mathilde’s [Medium article and Series A deck](https://collinmathilde.medium.com/front-series-a-deck-f2e2775a419b) both helped immensely when I was fundraising for [Ledgy’s Series A round](https://www.venturelab.swiss/Ledgy-raises-USD-10-million-Series-A-to-change-the-culture-of-equity-and-ownership). \n\nMy co-founders were closely involved when I was building our pitch deck. To ensure we had up-to-date information on customer acquisition, product development and other details, I relied on our heads of business development and engineering. Building a great deck is always a team effort!\n\nFinally, ask your existing investors and/or advisors to battle-test your pitch and really “rip you apart” to ensure you’re prepared for the hardest questions. Confidence is key for fundraising, and getting tested early on means you’re better prepared to face tough questions!\n\n- - -\n\n[Ledgy’s Series A pitch deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Ledgy-Pitch-Deck-5FHyB63NP3rT5J5AMX0dx2j9) and [Front’s Series C pitch deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Front-Pitch-Deck-5HdwRF4mfGJ34o3AQz5tk1Cn) can be found in Pitch’s [Female-Founded Startups](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) collection.\n\nThis is the second in our Founder Q\u0026A series, and we have more to come.

You're counting on investors to lend a hand with the resources you need to pursue your dream, but they’ve never been shorter on time or attention. So how do you design a pitch deck that commands attention and helps you ensure your idea gets heard?\n\nMartin Mignot knows a standout pitch when he sees one. The Index Ventures partner has established himself as one of Europe’s top VCs by leading early investments in unicorns like Deliveroo, Personio, and Revolut. Mignot has reviewed thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs’ pitch decks, and has a gift for spotting a diamond in the rough (and knows when he’s seen enough to make up his mind). We recently caught up with Mignot to pick his brain on the do’s and don’ts of designing and delivering pitches that break through.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/smallimage_indexventures.jpg] [alt:Martin Mignot Index Ventures] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**As someone who has reviewed thousands of pitch decks, what do you look for first?**\n\nThe first thing you try to do is to find the core information quickly. Who is the team? What is the problem being solved? How is it being solved? Who is using the company’s product? How are they using it? You’re looking to get a sense for what the business is like.\n\n**So for an entrepreneur who is designing a pitch deck, what’s the most important thing when it comes to conveying this information effectively?** \n\nMaking sure you present the right information — and not more. Anything that’s too long, that’s not to the point, becomes part of the noise and gets ignored.\n\n**Length is a good point. People talk a lot about making sure a pitch deck hits that balance between being informative but not boring. Is there a rule of thumb you generally suggest when it comes to length?** \n\nIf you haven’t conveyed your key information in 12 slides, it’s probably too long. You can have an appendix if you want, but if I read 12 slides I should have everything I need to know.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/IndexVenture_concise.jpg] [alt:] [caption:Convey your key information in 12 slides] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Let’s talk about visual storytelling. How can entrepreneurs make sure their visuals add to their story, and don’t distract from it?** \n\nThe best pitches typically tend to be conversations. Effective visuals help kick this conversation off. Really any sort of visuals that are surprising, challenging, or unexpected, those are the visuals you should be aiming for.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“The best pitches typically tend to be conversations.”] [footer:] [layout:indented] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nUltimately it’s a story. You want the founder to take you into their universe. When someone comes with a pitch and just talks *at* me, trying to cram all the information into 25 minutes and just opening up for questions at the end, that's the worst. I want to be carried across a story where I participate. It’s a bit like immersive theater. The storytelling is a journey that takes you somewhere, but you should also take part in it. \n\n**We've talked about [designing a pitch deck](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips), but presenting a pitch deck is a whole different beast. Thinking about the best pitches you've heard, what role does the slide deck play and how does it complement the speaker?** \n\nToday, decks need to be versatile enough to fit into two contexts: There’s the deck I read at home on my desktop. Here, I should have the information I need to know what’s going on. And then there’s the deck we review in our conversation, which should have things that call for questions, for clarification, or for explanation. Conversation openers. \n\n**Now more than ever, founders have to make sure their deck is compelling enough to stand on its own, even if they aren't able to deliver it in person. Do you have any tips for how to make a strong impression when pitching to VCs through a virtual medium (e.g., Zoom)?**\n\nHonestly, pitching is better today. Sure, I miss the physical part of pitching in person, but the virtual format removes a lot of the friction: scheduling, commuting, setting up the laptop. The physical world made it trickier to showcase digital content. Moving into a fully digital world has made it much more seamless. Even the rare technical glitches don’t really add on a lot of wasted time.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“The importance of having a well-designed pitch is even greater today.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBefore, most of the time when we meet with founders, we wouldn’t even have time to really go through the pitch deck. Today, every single pitching meeting involves a deck. The deck is the background of the discussion.\n\n**We can’t talk about startup pitches without talking about data. After all, so much of a pitch deck’s story is told in numbers. When it comes to storytelling through data, do you have any tips?**\n\nIn my view there are two important sets of numbers when it comes to visual storytelling: There’s the macro and the micro. \n\nMacro is all about market size and potential. Here, you want to see visualizations that use bubbles and areas to get a size for the scale, visual cues of sizes in comparison to each other. And then on the micro side of things, what’s very important is unit economics: If you sell one of something, what is your actual revenue, margin, and profit for the company? Here it’s all about waterfall-type graphs, which are great for breaking down each component.\n\nOne thing that really grates on me is when founders use cumulative data, like cumulative revenue, which is obviously hugely misleading. People know you want to see graphs that go up and to the right, and of course if you use cumulative numbers that’s what you see. It’s always going to go up and to the right! These visual tricks doesn’t mean the business is doing well.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/bigimage_indexventures.jpg] [alt:] [caption:Don't use visual tricks to try and make your stats look better. ] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Martin, we know your time and attention is in high demand. Thanks again so much for sharing it with us today. One final question for you: Is there information that startup founders should never include in a pitch deck?**\n\nAnything about exits. If you are raising Seed or Series A round and come in talking about how much you can sell for or IPO for, it gives the signal that all you're really interested in is exiting. It's too early for that. Instead, focus more on the size of the opportunity and how big of an impact you can make if you’re successful, but talking about how you’re going to sell the business you just started is typically the wrong way to think about it.\n\n## Martin's top tips for delivering the perfect remote pitch\n\n*Do* keep it short. You should be able to cover your key points in 12 slides. \n\n*Do* make sure your deck can stand on its own, especially if you aren’t there to deliver it in person.\n\n*Do* use visuals that function as conversation starters. \n\n*Do* make sure to engage your audience and not just talk at them. \n\n*Don't* try to use visual tricks to make your stats look better than they are. \n\n*Don't* talk about exits in your initial pitch. Instead, focus more on the size of the opportunity.\n"},{"type":"category","title":"Inside Pitch","excerpt":"","slug":"/blog/inside-pitch","content":""},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"Engagement analytics: Turn data into winning presentations","date":"2023-06-15T09:17:55.884Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Maresch Bär","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743989/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Header_MOBILE_Engagement_analytics_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743994/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Header_SMALL_Engagement_analytics_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743992/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Header_MID_Engagement_analytics_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743995/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Header_BIG_Engagement_analytics_w1920.png","image-description":"enagement analytics showing presentation and slide visits","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743989/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Engagement_analytics.png","thumbnail-description":"enagement analytics showing presentation and slide visits","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686743990/blog/Engagement%20analytics/Social_share_Engagement_analytics.png","meta-image-description":"enagement analytics showing presentation and slide visits","teaser-text":"With engagement analytics, you’ll get slide-by-slide insights into how your audience views your interactive decks and what catches their attention.","excerpt":"Anyone involved in winning new clients, projects, or funding is reliant on data.

Pitch has fixed this with the launch of engagement analytics. You can now send rich, interactive presentations to anyone, then access slide-by-slide insights into how your audience views your decks.\n\nLike with websites and emails, having data about presentations leads to better choices that increase the win rate for your pitches. If a deck isn’t convincing someone, it’s either because your offer isn’t the right fit or your content doesn’t resonate. Now, you can use analytics to understand which one it is. You’ll see when people visit a link to your deck and — with the introduction of engagement analytics for custom links — where they spend their time. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1686747127/blog/Engagement%20analytics/engagement-analytics-gif.gif] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nLet’s look at how Pitch helps you focus your time on the right opportunities and capture people’s attention.\n\n## The evolution of link analytics in Pitch\n\nThere’s a slide deck behind almost every new client, project, or funding round. While all Pitch users can create public links, [Pitch Pro](https://pitch.com/pro) users can also [create custom links](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6046701-create-custom-links-to-your-presentations) for any deck, adding optional passcodes to limit access. Once you’ve shared your presentation with specific groups or channels, you’ll be able to see when someone opens it.\n\n“Custom links have been a game-changer. Pitch has definitely had a positive impact on our sales process,” says Jimmy Gordon, the Business Development Director at [Myth](https://www.mythstudio.co.uk/) — an animation house that has won over clients like Budweiser, Fanta, and Mars.\n\nWhile presentation visits are a useful indicator of general interest, we’ve learned that teams need more insights to understand exactly how their audience engages with decks and what catches their attention. That’s why we’ve added engagement analytics to custom links, so you can see which slides people have viewed, and for how long.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Engagement analytics means we’re no longer left guessing if a prospect has finished reading one of our decks or gave up on it halfway through.”] [footer:Jimmy Gordon, Myth] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAccording to Jimmy, “Engagement analytics means we’re no longer left guessing if a prospect has finished reading one of our decks or gave up on it halfway through. Before we arrange a follow-up call, we can see who’s a cold, warm, or hot lead, and which parts of a deck they care about most.”\n\nUnlike document-sharing tools like Docsend, presentations shared from Pitch support videos, recordings, and animations. Interactive elements like these help you tell a richer story — no matter when and where recipients view your slides. With Pitch, you no longer have to choose between the most engaging format and the insights into what’s working.\n\n## Discover what captures attention and what’s ignored\n\nAs we all know, time and attention are scarce resources — people skip the content they consider boring or irrelevant. So when they actually take the time to read and fully grasp everything on a slide, you know they’re genuinely interested. You can use these insights to front-load your deck with the most attention-grabbing slides. Plus, you can shape your follow-up conversations based on your audience’s interest in a certain topic, or the information they never got to in the pre-read.\n\nFor example, if people spent two seconds or less on a slide, they just glanced at it and probably didn’t process a lot of information. Anything up to ten seconds means they’ve at least skimmed the slide content. And if they’ve spent even more time on a slide, something has definitely caught their attention.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n “By analyzing the engagement data, we can tailor our presentations more precisely to our customers’ needs.”] [footer:Benita Schmidt, Hive] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nE-commerce logistics startup [Hive](https://www.hive.app/) was among the first to field-test engagement analytics. “I love how straightforward it is to configure analytics,” says Benita Schmidt, their Business Development Lead for Germany. Seeing metrics like time spent on slides has already helped them work smarter: “By analyzing the engagement data, we can tailor our presentations more precisely to our customers’ needs.”\n\nBeyond telling you which slides get the most traction, engagement analytics also reveals which ones get ignored. With slide views, you’ll know what content your visitors have missed and if there’s a spot where they frequently drop off. Use these insights to follow up with essential information, prepare for your next call, and tweak your deck’s length and structure.\n\n## Help us build the future of presentation analytics\n\nEngagement analytics opens up new opportunities for anyone using presentations to win work, but there’s even more to come. We’ll continue to expand Pitch’s analytics capabilities based on user feedback. By equipping teams with actionable data on presentations, every pitch will be more likely to succeed. We’ll also explore ways to seamlessly integrate analytics into existing workflows.\n\nWhich other metrics would you like to see in Pitch? And how can presentation analytics best support your work?

Today marks a major milestone as we exceed our original vision to become the complete platform for presentations. Meet Pitch 2.0 — the new standard for how teams can create, collaborate on, deliver, and analyze decks. \n\n[Since 2020](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-launches), Pitch has been adopted by [over one million teams](https://pitch.com/blog/one-million-teams) of all sizes. Along the way, we’ve continually expanded on our mission to raise the value of the world’s ideas — celebrating feature releases like our [template gallery](https://pitch.com/blog/60-product-updates-q1-in-review) of custom decks, an asset [library](https://pitch.com/blog/manage-your-brand-in-the-library), [presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics), personalized [recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings), and integrations with [Slack](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-app-for-slack) and [Notion](https://pitch.com/blog/present-async-in-your-notion-workspace). \n\nBut our UI was looking tired, some teams were struggling with restrictive plans, engagement analytics were hard to access, and users were clamoring for animations. We also knew there was a lot of [opportunity around AI](https://pitch.com/blog/finding-focus-in-the-generative-ai-whirlwind) and wanted to deliver a future-focused feature with real, lasting value for our users.\n\nIt was time for a glow-up.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1699859085/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/academy-kc-first_example.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Jump-start the creation process with AI\n\nEver wondered how much time you’ve wasted staring at a blank slide? Getting over that initial hurdle in the creation process is often the hardest part. We’ve been aware of this since the early days of Pitch, which is why we launched a [gallery of free templates](https://pitch.com/templates) designed by experts.\n\nOur new AI presentation generator takes this idea to the next level. Built to help when the spark isn’t sparking, it’s the fastest way to create decks on any topic. \n\nTo use the free generator on the homepage or in-app, just enter a prompt, select a color palette and font, and voilà — blank slides are magically filled in seconds. You get the same design quality and appeal of our human-crafted templates, but with topic-specific ideas for deck structure, content, and layouts. Generate as many decks as you like, and quickly visualize different slide options, fonts, and color schemes before moving on to more customized editing.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1699865956/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/links.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Know what’s working with presentation analytics\n\nPresentation analytics are one of our most powerful, and beloved, features. Insights — like how many people have viewed which slides, and for how long — enable teams to understand who’s engaged, and what part of their messaging is resonating best. But analytics were unavailable to free users, and hard to find for others. \n\nWith Pitch 2.0, we’ve revamped the whole sharing process. The streamlined Share menu enables you to create links, invite others to collaborate on a deck, or export it as a PDF file. And a new [links overview page](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5132455-see-all-your-team-s-links-in-one-place) lets you manage all your outreach in one place, so you can quickly share a link, control access, or track who has engaged with each presentation. \n\nUsers can create passcode-protected links for their decks, and personalize the URLs to the recipients. And all teams can now try our analytics tools to experience the value of gathering slide-level data, and learn what’s working (and what’s not).\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1699892525/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/continuity-4.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Wow your audience with animations\n\nWe've always been about design excellence, but slides were static when we started out. The only way to add some motion was to embed content like GIFs or videos. So in 2022, we introduced the [focus effect](https://pitch.com/whats-new/introducing-the-focus-effect-in-the-player) as a way to highlight one visual element at a time. Then in 2023, we unlocked a wide range of motion use cases with [enter and exit animations](https://pitch.com/whats-new/make-things-disappear-with-exit-animations) to guide your narrative.\n\nNow we’re excited for you to meet continuity, a slide transition that lets you animate related content from one slide to the next — with a single click. Blocks float and shift as you transition between slides, keeping your story flowing and viewers hooked. \n\nThis isn’t just for show (although it’s a great show); the continuity effect also makes complex ideas crystal clear. You can link concepts in the form of text, images, videos, embeds, and shapes to captivate your audience and effortlessly lead them through your presentation.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1699859805/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/Duplication.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Share your creative vision with your crowd\n\nHave you noticed that Pitch is looking a little…shinier? Pitch’s UI has received a refresh, from a *brand*-new icon and intuitive buttons to bright gradients and menus that are easier to navigate. It’s never been faster, or more fun, to create a deck.\n\nAnd after a conference, class, or burst of creativity, you can now opt to share your presentation publicly with our [new duplication button](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748926-share-a-presentation-with-others\u0026sa=D\u0026source=docs\u0026ust=1699871355562922\u0026usg=AOvVaw1cY_nbKOwHHrYe2kDRRdO7). That way, people can use your deck as a template, get inspired, build on your ideas, and remix the content for their own use.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1699884641/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/Announcement_blog_Pricing_asset_1.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## New plans for every type of team\n\nA lot has changed since our first public launch, and yet our plans have remained the same. Along with today’s release, we’re introducing new packages that better match the value teams are getting with Pitch, so everyone can find the setup that works best for them. \n\nFormerly known as Starter, the **Free** plan is ideal for individuals and small teams. Users can work together on an unlimited number of presentations, making use of the AI generator, the brand library, and links to share live presentations. If it wasn’t obvious, the Free plan is — and will always be — free.\n\n**Pro** has evolved but is still the best plan for people who need to deliver professional decks and collaborate with others. Teams with Pro get unbranded exports, and can upload videos to their brand library. They can also manage version history for presentations, and invite teammates like guests and [commenters](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/8102572-about-the-commenter-role\u0026sa=D\u0026source=docs\u0026ust=1699871420663161\u0026usg=AOvVaw12NoJnIPx4RqZmIrf6mP_R) (a new role in Pitch 2.0) to join their workspace at no additional cost.\n\nThe **Business** plan is perfect for teams that use Pitch to win work. It expands on Pro with even more capacity for commenters and guests. Crucially, it provides full access to presentation analytics, with plenty of links to measure deck engagement.\n\n**Enterprise** users get all of Pitch’s features, including single sign-on (SSO) and a dedicated customer success manager, at a price that works for their unique use case. You can take a closer look at each plan [here](https://pitch.com/pricing).\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1699865954/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0/Pitch_logo2023_reveal_1.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## What does the future hold?\n\nToday marks a major milestone, yes — but it also opens the next chapter of Pitch’s journey. \n\nWe believe the future of business will be visual, and that compelling presentations are the best way to share ideas that capture hearts and change minds. As such, Pitch 2.0 serves as a launchpad to continue redefining how the world connects.\n\nWe’ll keep exploring how AI can be leveraged to help you level up your presentations and scale outreach. By incorporating AI and analytics, we’ll create a system that supports ongoing learning and drives demonstrable results.\n\nOf course, design and collaboration will always be at the center of everything we do. From high-fidelity tools on the canvas to immersive motion and audience interactivity, changes in 2024 and beyond will allow teams to share bigger and bolder ideas with dynamic decks that match their ambitions.\n\nAs we continue building Pitch, we want to hear from you.

But many presentations are never presented live, so how do you know if your ideas have made an impact? When you’re fundraising or selling, you might rely on a separate tool to get insights into who’s viewing your work. In the process, you’re adding extra steps to your workflow, and paying extra for the privilege. \n\nWith Pitch, presentation analytics are baked into the core experience. So you can go from idea to insight to impact without duct-taping a separate stack. If you need to tweak your deck along the way, you can iterate from the editor instead of juggling exported files and multiple versions. And best of all? Analytics are available to all members in your workspace. Now everyone from the CEO to junior employees can tap into insights on which decks are getting read — when, where, and by whom.\n\n### See internal and external analytics in one place\n\nHere’s how to get started: Open any presentation and you’ll see a new analytics icon at the top of the editor. Click the icon to open the analytics menu, which combines visitor activity from members, guests, and external audiences.  \n\nSee a feed of visits, complete with location, device, and timestamp, so you can see when and where audiences consume your work. If you’ve embedded a presentation or shared a public link, you’ll be able to view a chart of visits over time, to see when there’s a spike in activity. \n\n### **Stay in control of sharing with custom links and passcodes**\n\nWith this release, we’re also introducing custom links, a powerful new way to share your presentation with specific audiences. Instead of duplicating your pitch deck or passing around a single public link, now you can create multiple links for any presentation, each with a descriptive URL and optional passcode. If you’re on the go, you can even [create a custom link from Pitch for mobile](https://pitch.com/download). \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1648713895/blog/2_EMBED_CUSTOM_LINKS_OVERVIEW__1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1648795312/blog/2_EMBED_CUSTOM_LINKS_OVERVIEW.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\\\nYou can analyze each link separately, giving you greater insight into when a certain audience is viewing your presentation without compromising on data privacy. And if you need to stop sharing a deck with someone, you can disable individual links without disrupting how other groups access the deck.\\\n\\\nFor teams involved in winning new clients and partners, custom links open up powerful new opportunities to gain insights on messaging, pricing and more. \"Whether we're leveraging Pitch for internal knowledge exchanges, or introducing high-value decks that bring brands over the line from prospects to Frontify customers, the enhanced visibility we have through presentation analytics gives us the insights we need to ensure we're communicating clearly and effectively,\" said Shannon Healey, Head of Marketing ad-interim at Frontify. \"We can see what's resonating and with whom, and make quick adaptions to ensure we're hitting the mark.\n\n### What’s next: real-time notifications, slide-level engagement, and more\n\nWe’ll be further developing presentation analytics so you can zoom in to understand the performance of individual slides, and zoom out to understand your team's performance with a workspace-level dashboard.\n\nYou can expect incremental improvements over the coming months, starting with engagement. With slide-level analytics, you’ll be able to see how much time people spend with your deck, how many slides they view, and more. Insights in hand, you’ll know which slides are most captivating and where you need to sharpen your storytelling. \\\n\\\nNext, we’ll focus on notifications. When you’re pitching something important, real-time updates are essential. Soon, whether you’re at your desk or on the go, you’ll get an alert when someone first opens a custom link.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1648713893/blog/3_EMBED_ANIMATION__1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1648795312/blog/3_EMBED_ANIMATION.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\\\n\\\nUnderstanding the performance of an individual presentation is helpful, but what if you could surface insights from across your entire workspace? In the future, we want to give teams a comprehensive analytics dashboard where they can see trends across decks, understand how collateral is used, and make sure their team is tapping into the full power of Pitch. We think this will offer sales enablement, marketing, and operations teams a modern and centralized resource for supporting their stakeholders. \n\n### Get started with presentation analytics\n\nIf you’re part of a Pro workspace, you’ll be able to start working with presentation analytics right away. And Starter workspaces can look forward to a basic version of analytics in the future. [Check out our pricing page](https://pitch.com/pricing) to learn more about Pitch Pro.\\\n\\\nWe built presentation analytics to help founders fine-tune their fundraising, and help sales teams perfect their proposals. As we continue to develop the feature, we want to hear firsthand from you on the value it’s delivering, and how we can improve it.

Collaboration isn’t confined to rooms (or even Zooms) anymore. But we’re all still suffering through endless meetings, and feeling more isolated than ever, because our tools haven’t kept pace with the way we work now.\n\nPresentations are key to solving these challenges. But to do so, they need to evolve beyond the purpose they used to serve — static, visual meeting aids — and into a dynamic medium that helps teams’ best thinking flow.\n\nThat's why we're [introducing recordings](https://pitch.com/use-cases/video-presentation-maker), a new way for teams to present together through short, expressive videos recorded directly on their slides.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/f8a196d0-4dd2-43fc-b368-2aefbcb3a1ee\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Present your best thinking together\n\nDelivering a pitch used to mean aligning schedules, coordinating prep time, and spending time away from family and friends. The rise of remote work removed the need to travel far from home, but delivering a pitch still required a meeting. \n\nNow, that’s finally changing. We’re at the beginning of the shift toward truly asynchronous work.\n\nToday, VCs and sales leads can be pitched without meetings, and new funding and customers can be won anytime. But human connection still wins, so to create a personalized asynchronous pitch, teams still have to choose between struggling with multiple tools or spending heavily on external production support. \n\nNow, with Pitch, there’s a better way.\n\nWe built recordings directly into the slide editing and sharing experience. Just add a recording block — like you’d add text or an image — and position it alongside your other slide content. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1649947583/blog/1_AddingRecording_1200w_1.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1649953297/blog/1_AddingRecording_1200w.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\\\nOnce you’re ready to record, you can record as many takes as you need for each slide. Or, if you know your lines by heart, record across multiple slides in a single take. \n\nAnd because great pitches often feature multiple faces, we’ve made it simple for several people to add recordings to a single deck. Your team can switch speaking roles, test variations in messaging, and continue to update and iterate on your slides afterward. No more manually stitching takes together; no more do-overs from the beginning to nail your delivery. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1649947487/blog/4_PickTake_1200w_1.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1649953296/blog/4_PickTake_1200w.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Get up to speed at your own speed\n\nRecordings also give recipients the flexibility to get up to speed when they’re ready, not when everyone’s schedules happen to align.\n\nAs a remote-first team ourselves, we’ve traded live standups and all-hands for more asynchronous forms of communication, so we know firsthand the importance of sharing updates in a way that works for everyone. With recordings, you can turn every slide into its own full, on-demand viewing experience.\n\nAny member in your workspace can add recordings to slides, and anyone with access to a presentation can watch them. Open the player, and you’ll see the option to play presentations with recordings and manage playback speed. Together with comments and reactions, you can consume updates and share your feedback in one place.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1649947656/blog/2_Playback_1200w_1.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1649953297/blog/2_Playback_1200w.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Personalize and perfect your pitch\n\nThese days, a winning story isn’t one-size-fits-all, and it can’t be crafted in a silo. \n\nWhether you’re a founder raising funding or a salesperson courting customers, you’re likely facing a unique challenge: You’re getting more feedback than ever, you need to integrate it continuously, and you don’t have nearly enough time to do so — all while trying to build personal relationships remotely.\n\nRecordings turn a painstaking process into a breeze, because they can be reused across presentations or even saved as templates. Now, you can record the core of your story once, spend more time on personalized intros, and send out truly personalized pitches as rich, engaging pre-reads. (And with [presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics), you can see who’s consuming your work.)\n\nThe result? When you meet with investors and leads, you can spend time building trust, and fielding questions, rather than delivering the basics of your pitch.\\\n\\\n\"Pitching can be a time-consuming and taxing process for founders,\" said Selcuk Atli, co-founder and CEO of Bunch, a metaverse application for multiplayer games. \"Recordings in Pitch have totally improved our communications with investors and game developers. By sending a short narrated presentation before meetings, we are able to get into more meaningful discussions, questions, and feedback during meetings. We are also able to communicate our message effectively to the rest of their teams by sharing a narrated presentation after our meetings.\"\n\n### Start using recordings today\n\nRecordings are available to everyone starting today. For the next three months, Starter and Pro workspaces can add recordings to any presentation. To help you get inspired, we’ve launched a new collection on our presentation gallery that highlights the power of adding video narratives to published decks. \n\nWe’ve also integrated recordings into some of our most popular templates, and we’ve added two new templates — an [async sales deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge) and [async pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Pitch-Deck-4eZnrJ38hgp65jWXha4xdJFp) — purpose-built with recordings in mind.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1649851731/blog/3_Pitch_Deck_with_Clips_Row_1.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1650356044/blog/async-pitch-deck.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\\\nToday’s release represents our first step toward enabling presenters to deliver engaging, impactful narratives, no matter if they’re async or live, at their desk or on the go. \n\nWe can’t wait to hear how you and your team make use of recordings — be sure to [join our Slack community](https://pitch.com/community) to share your feedback and show us what you’re building."},{"type":"blog","category":["News","Product Updates"],"title":"Introducing the Pitch presentation gallery","date":"2021-11-17T09:38:42.687Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"John McClelland","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063560/blog/Header_MOBILE_Publishing_beta_announcement_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063561/blog/Header_SMALL_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063559/blog/Header_MID_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063560/blog/Header_BIG_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1920.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063558/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Publishing_beta_announcement.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1637063610/blog/Social_share_Publishing_beta_announcement.jpg","teaser-text":"Today, we’re rolling out the Pitch presentation gallery, and launching publishing as a beta program for creators.

This summer, we debuted the first [creator profiles](https://pitch.com/blog/creator-profiles-the-future-of-publishing), and today, we’re taking another big step toward bringing our vision to life: We're rolling out the Pitch presentation gallery, and launching publishing as a beta program for creators. \n\nIt’s been a full year since we launched, and thousands of teams now use Pitch to create, collaborate on, and deliver presentations. Now, we’re giving our community a new way to publish standout work, grow an online presence, and learn from one another: the [Pitch presentation gallery](https://pitch.com/presentations). \n\nTo mark the launch of the gallery, we’ve curated a selection of world-class content on all aspects of work: fundraising, hiring, marketing, design, and more. We’re also opening a new beta program for creators to publish their own presentations on public profiles.\n\n## Introducing a new home for presentations\n\nPresentations are the best way to communicate complex ideas in simple, digestible terms. But they’ve never had a dedicated home. As a result, too many brilliant startup proposals, product concepts, and leadership strategies have gone undiscovered. Previous presentation galleries have all been too static, too cold, and haven’t done justice to creators and brands. We think it’s time to change that.\n\nPitch will be a new kind of destination for presentations. Because we’re building a complete platform that connects presentation creation and publication, our users can bring their best thinking to life and share it with the world — all on Pitch.\n\nIn the future, if you’re a Pitch user, you’ll be able to establish an online presence with your own creator profile, and discover other profiles with success stories, helpful tips, and inspiring ideas from like-minded individuals and brands. And we’ll showcase the very best presentations as featured content in our [presentation gallery](https://pitch.com/presentations) to help everyone in our community find the creative spark for their next presentation.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/fps_30-30/blog/1_Presentation_Gallery_1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1636714068/blog/1_Presentation_Gallery_1200w_fallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Become one of the first Pitch creators \n\nWe'll soon be rolling out the capability to publish presentations directly to public creator profiles. A select group of Pitch users will be the first to gain access to this new feature over the next few weeks.

Eventually, everyone will be able to publish presentations to their own creator profile. \n\nWe can’t wait to see our community bring this ecosystem to life.\n\n*Update: Note that we’re no longer accepting applicants to the publishing beta.

Feedback would flow in through email and Slack, and then you'd have to send a Zoom link to share your screen to edit your deck together. All of which means a ton of back and forth, and a ton of valuable time lost.\n\nLast month we shipped live video collaboration, a new way for teams to host video or audio calls directly in a presentation. Collaborate on a slide, hold a team meeting, or have a casual chat when you notice someone working on the same deck.\n\nLet's say a copywriter and designer are both teaming up on a [case study deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Case-Study-38oLoh6CCMe35ribX77Wg56g) or [partnership proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Partnership-Proposal-6wL7ba0x13Uo5THCdy5ukn5x).

Because while it's great to see what others are doing, sometimes you want to talk through the details together in real time. It's also great for spontaneous collaboration. If you’re in a presentation and see another teammate is viewing it, you can start a live session to start working together or to simply say hi.\n\n## **Live video collaboration templates**\n\nReady to get started? We created a set of presentation templates that are designed to work alongside live video collaboration to showcase some of the most popular use cases and give you a bit of inspiration.\n\nThere are tons of creative ways to put live video collaboration to use for everything from [professional brainstorming](https://pitch.com/templates/Retrospective-5kXBRH2mX1f44Ty5wf5q4Mc9) to [social bonding](https://pitch.com/templates/Virtual-Hangouts-7XEEMi6YNFRv4vbUH805WtDd). After all, we may not be able to recreate water cooler chats, but we can make presentations a place for spontaneity and fun. \n\n## Host a remote workshop like a pro\n\nBrainstorming. Whiteboarding. The vestiges of office life. Workshops are a good reason/excuse to get in a room together (albeit in a virtual one) and quickly figure out a lot of things in one hour. While workshops offer a space for creativity and free-form thinking, going into them with a solid structure helps you ensure everyone's time is well spent. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/b658241c-c8be-4660-a3e1-32c9aadbb04a?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Work hard, play hard with interactive games\n\nYou'd never think you'd [play bingo in Pitch](https://pitch.com/templates/Virtual-Team-Games-4Vfetp3w28Um5aFg6H4ewaMT), did you?

And let’s face it, the current process isn’t exactly ideal. \n\nCopying and pasting data. Tracking down and updating the right metrics. Trying to figure out how to show the numbers in the most easy-to-digest manner. These are just a few of the challenges that make reporting workflows overly complex and time-consuming. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nIn this post, we’ll look at how real teams are using Pitch to make their reporting workflows more efficient and collaborative. See how Bonzer creates multilingual client reports with ease, how Rows makes preparing for board meetings less painful, and how we track our own performance using Pitch. Plus, get pro tips for using Pitch to [create reports](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports) like a true power user.\n\n## Reporting to clients: How Bonzer demonstrates impact through data\n\nPresenting data is about more than putting numbers on a slide — it’s about making a point. And nothing sabotages great results quite like a poor presentation. No one knows this better than agencies. We spoke with [Bonzer](http://bonzer.io), an SEO agency based in Copenhagen, about how they were able to change their [SEO reporting](https://pitch.com/templates/SEO-Report-5xZdZD0FvgdS4mRDru3m5fGW) workflow to put more time into adding valuable context and education on SEO through data, and less time fiddling with [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips).  \n\n“Data reports have the power to educate clients and help them understand the process of creating sustainable organic growth,” Fanny Josefine Fredskilde, Director of Bonzer Denmark, explains. “Educating our clients improves the collaboration since we share an understanding of how organic growth works and thus have a strong common ground for more advanced and creative strategies.”\n\nBecause SEO is an ongoing process, the only way to display success is to report numbers continuously over time (in their case, every few months). Before discovering Pitch, the Bonzer team would use screenshots from Google Analytics pasted into shared Google Docs. Not only was this form of reporting not very visual, but the charts often hid the importance of changes in the data.\n\n“With Pitch, we were able to create charts that did the data justice”, Fanny says and continues, ”SEO is a complex field with numerous data points and often the key is to look in the right places in order to understand how your SEO initiatives are impacting the business. Pitch helps us to show the points of impact more clearly.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“With Pitch, we were able to create charts that did the data justice.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nServicing global clients also presents a unique challenge: localization. Bonzer creates reports in Danish, Swedish, and English. The pre-Pitch process was tedious, involving lots of careful pasting and restyling. With [templates](https://pitch.com/templates), they're able to keep core reports consistent across languages and enable their strategists to spend more time on insights and less time on formatting.\n\n“I was able to design a gorgeous template without any design skills or background,” Anne Egdal, a Team Lead at Bonzer, says. She went far beyond just using screenshots from Google Search Console and Google Analytics, adding Bonzer’s brand colors and fonts to lay the foundation of how their charts should look like. \n\nHere’s a real-world example of the reports they use to keep clients up to date.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/97895853-1d15-4522-858e-ba5ffd5fee73?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch improved Bonzer’s daily work in more ways:\n\n* Being able to customize charts helped Bonzer highlight the data that is in focus and shed light on what matters.\n* Having templates and shared styles in Pitch made creating presentations efficient and repeatable for the entire team. \n* Templatizing the process helped them create presentations in multiple languages faster, which was critical when working with so many international clients.\n\n**Pro tip: Import existing data**\n\nYou can save lots of time when [creating reports in Pitch](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports). Upload a CSV file, import a Google Sheet, or connect Pitch to Google Analytics to create up-to-date, error-free charts based on the latest data. Just pick an integration from the charts menu or select **Replace chart data** when editing an existing chart.\n\n## Reporting to the board: How Rows shares insights with investors\n\n[Rows](https://rows.com/) is a next-generation spreadsheet tool that combines traditional spreadsheets with built-in integrations to help teams be more productive and get work done faster. Naturally, the team is made up of spreadsheet power users, but even they find themselves turning to presentations when they want to put key numbers into context. \n\nFor instance, when it comes to [board meetings](https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-5WNEjL4zD9815VDStw4Vt6SS), it's important that key numbers are easy to consume and understand. Their Head of Growth, Henrique Cruz, works with the co-founders to create the decks ahead of each meeting. While before, prepping for a board meeting meant lots of unnecessary back and forth. \n\nWith Pitch, one person can create an outline, and — using comments and slide assignments — they can divvy up the work. Best of all, quickly visualizing data in a nice, easy-to-understand way is super simple.\n\n“What I like about Pitch is that it’s easy to build nice-looking charts,” Henrique says, “Normally, what you want to do with charts is to remove gridlines, remove legends, and make the data values big. These settings are one click away in Pitch. With Google Slides, it would take a bunch of clicks.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“What I like about Pitch is that it’s easy to build nice-looking charts.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs a modern tool, Pitch gives them an equally modern solution that helps them visually highlight the important data without spending too much time on unnecessary back and forth.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/smallimage2_reportingworkflow.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Pro tip: Visualize a trendline**\n\nDid you notice the trendline in the top chart? The team at Rows has come up with a neat trick to add context to their charts. To create a trendline, duplicate the bar chart, turn it into a line chart, adjust the scale to your needs, and layer it precisely on the original bar chart. Then go to the **Design** panel and toggle of categories and scale. Make sure only the line is visible. Et voilà! \n\n## Reporting to the team: How Pitch tracks company KPIs\n\nOur team uses Pitch for recurring reports like our weekly KPI reports and quarterly product health checks. These reports enable us to quickly align the company on the top metrics we’re tracking around growth, sales, adoption, and customer satisfaction.  \n\nOne of the main reasons we love [using Pitch to build these reports](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports) is that everyone can work together in the same presentation. Using comments and slide assignments, we’re able to easily track ongoing conversations and see exactly who is responsible for doing what. Centralizing communication in Pitch makes the process of collecting stats more efficient and seamless between teams. \n\nAnd after the presentation has been shared with the company, we use comments to get a conversation going. Anyone in the company can ask questions or share thoughts about the reports. No more staring at stats wondering what they actually mean — Pitch makes reporting truly collaborative, from creation to follow-up.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/smallimage4_reportingworkflow.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSince we store these presentations in their dedicated folder, anyone inside our company can easily see where we stand today, as well as look back on historical performance. \n\n## Community spotlight: Transforming folders into creative KPI dashboards \n\nWe’re constantly inspired by how our community finds innovative ways to use Pitch. When it comes to reporting, some of our users have gotten creative in making sure key points are seen. Take Florent. \n\nFlorent Merian is in charge of marketing at [DynamicScreen](https://dynamicscreen.com/). He likes to share reports with his team in Pitch, and he wanted to make it as easy and fast as possible for them to see key metrics at a glance. So, he created a dashboard in Pitch by making a dedicated workspace folder that includes previews of single slide presentations. Each presentation’s preview shows one key metric they are tracking, offering an up-to-date view of where the company stands.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/smallimage_reporting.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Build a better reporting workflow with Pitch\n\nNo matter who you are and what you do, we know there are better things to do than wrestle with charts. We’re here to help you focus on insights, so you can spend time driving results, not struggling with how to present them. \n\nWe hope you’ve picked up a few new tips to streamline your recurring [reports](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports).

Since everything lives online, any updates you make are immediately available to your team. \n\n### The right brand assets — right where teams need them\n\nThe easiest way to keep teams on-brand is to put everything they need at their fingertips. Now, your brand templates, fonts, and assets are available directly from the editor. So sales doesn’t have to turn to their desktop, Dropbox, or Google Search to find the right image. Instead, they can create perfectly polished presentations without leaving Pitch. \n\nZach Grosser, Founder and Managing Director of [Zacht Studios](https://pitch.com/u/zacht), notes that saved time translates to real benefits. “I'm excited to have our library of assets directly in Pitch to reduce the number of tools—and the amount of time—used on every project. Every little bit of time saved is an increase in our profits and customer satisfaction.”\n\n### Help shape what’s next\n\nThe library is a crucial part of our product vision. Over the coming months, we’ll be introducing improvements to help more established brands organize and maintain their library in Pitch. If you’ve had a chance to explore the library, [we’d love to hear what you think](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/AKbLs6ab)!\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"Managing growing teams in Pitch","date":"2022-08-18T07:37:32.309Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808358/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Header_MOBILE_Improving_Pitch_for_Growing_Teams_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808359/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Header_SMALL_Improving_Pitch_for_Growing_Teams_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808359/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Header_MID_Improving_Pitch_for_Growing_Teams_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808359/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Header_BIG_Improving_Pitch_for_Growing_Teams_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808358/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Improving_Pitch_for_Growing_Teams.png","teaser-text":"We’re making it easier for large teams to organize their workspace, manage collaboration, and stay productive.\n","excerpt":"Information sprawl is an inevitable challenge for fast-growing companies.

There’s nothing more frustrating than spending a half-hour scanning your company wiki or file management system just to find an approved presentation template or the latest sales deck. \n\nThat’s precisely why we’ve put so much energy into making Pitch workspaces easy to manage and navigate. When approved work is right where you need it, you can spend less time searching and more time on the work that matters most. \n\nAnd now, we’re making it even easier for large teams to navigate their workspace and collaborate effectively. Starting today, you’ll find subfolders and a host of small — but mighty — UX improvements in your Pitch workspace. \n\n## Organize presentations in subfolders \n\nWe’ve seen teams all over the world adopt Pitch for everything from recruiting to company updates to [sales proposals](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-sell-async-with-pitch). But advanced rituals and workflows strained the existing workspace structure. With nearly 200 folders, even *our* team workspace was feeling the pain. \n\nWith subfolders, teams finally have a way to give the information in their workspace a clear hierarchy. Top-level folders can be used for departments, clients, or initiatives, and subfolders can be nested within to create more logical groupings around teams, quarters, stages, and more. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1660808476/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Creating_subfolders.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808536/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Screen_Shot_2022-08-18_at_09.42.13.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSubfolders are also available from our [mobile apps](https://pitch.com/download), so you can quickly find the right deck even when you’re on the go. \n\n## Duplicate decks and quickly access templates \n\nCollaboration can be messy. As workspaces grow, the odds of someone accidentally editing existing templates — or a client-facing deck — increase. To minimize these accidents, we’re introducing several small improvements to reduce confusion and make building off of existing work easier.\n\n### Manage and organize decks from the editor\n\nPreviously, duplicating and moving presentations was only possible from the workspace. Now, you can stay in flow by doing it all from the editor. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1661248870/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Duplicating_Presentations_3.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1660808516/blog/Managing%20growing%20teams%20in%20Pitch/Screen_Shot_2022-08-18_at_09.41.52.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Access templates from the sidebar\n\nAt the start of the year, we [introduced the library](https://pitch.com/blog/manage-your-brand-in-the-library) to help teams organize their brand templates, fonts, and assets. We envisioned that designers and brand managers would populate the library with materials their team could reference from the editor; however, it became clear that many members also considered the library a starting point for their presentation — sometimes editing important templates in the process. \n\nTo reduce the chances of this happening, we’ve made several UX improvements to the library to make it clearer when you’re editing an original template. We’ve also added an easy entry point to your library templates at the top of your workspace sidebar. Click it and you’ll see a list of ready-to-use templates.\n\n### Coming soon: Track action items right from Slack \n\nWe’re also working on ways to help you stay on top of important action items outside of Pitch. In the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out the Pitch app for Slack. Receive notifications about mentions, replies, assignments, and invites in a single feed and quickly jump to the slides that need your attention.\n\n## There’s more on the way \n\nOur top priority is to make Pitch fast, intuitive, and joyful for teams of all sizes. In the coming months, you can look forward to more improvements that support better cross-functional and external stakeholder collaboration.

Having worked in startups for the last 10 years I’ve personally seen the good, the bad, and the ugly and learned a lot about what it means to be a woman in the tech industry. Working in the People space has also given me a unique perspective about what it takes to build an inclusive organization and how embracing diversity makes a team thrive. \n\nWith Pitch, my co-founders and I knew from the beginning we wanted to do things differently. As we built the company, we focused on creating an inclusive culture from the start and put an emphasis on remote work and flexibility. This helped us scale our team and improve our gender diversity ratio in a short amount of time. There is still so much to do (we are not yet at equal representation) but we are proud of what we’ve achieved so far. To date, we’ve brought on 19 women, 10 of whom are in strategic positions within the organization. I am particularly excited about one of our newest hires, Åsa Liden, who recently joined our team as VP of Engineering, bringing another strong female voice into our leadership team.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to focus on promoting people from different backgrounds into leadership roles, as well as raising internal awareness to the importance of diversity and inclusion. On our mission to build a sustainable company, we believe this approach sets out the right company values from the very start.\n\n## Make space for all women in the ever-growing tech industry\n\nThe challenge is a reality for all of us, especially in tech and business. The current statistics paint a clear picture of where we stand when it comes to gender equality. They're also an indicator of how long it will take to close the gender gap globally. However, we believe that as an organization, we can start with us and build up from there.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/asa.jpg] [alt:Asa Liden VP Engineering at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"I grew up in Sweden and have worked on multiple tech products in different organizations and industries. While my engineering career started with insurance software, I've gone on to work on music at Spotify, birth control at Natural Cycles and now, presentation software at Pitch. With so many diverse challenges, tech offers a wealth of opportunities for both women and men. Both are equally needed. We need to encourage women to take bold risks and be confident in all the knowledge they possess, as well as the unique value they bring to the tech world.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/maria.jpg] [alt:Maria Geller Software Developer at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"I was born and raised in Berlin, moved to New Zealand for a few years, and now live in Austria, where I work remotely. Throughout my career, I have found it very important to have role models at different levels and areas in the company. Role models make it possible to imagine yourself in that position one day. As a woman in tech, I hope that I can encourage others to not only pursue careers in the industry but also to dream big and consider moving into a leadership position if they are interested.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/tee.jpg] [alt:Tree Tran Visual Designer at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"I'm an Asian American who was raised in San Francisco, where I grew up with a lot of other immigrant families from various countries. My favorite thing about growing up in that city (aside from the diverse range of cuisine!) was hearing everyone's immigration stories and getting exposed to so many different perspectives. To me, being a female in tech means being able to contribute opinions and ideas which may not have been considered previously.\n\nPitch is one of the only places I've worked where I really see women being encouraged and supported into leadership roles. It's refreshing and a huge sign that the company cares about representation.\"\n\n## Build an inclusive leadership culture\n\nTo do this, we need to start with asking “What does leadership mean to us?” We are in an era where we need to reconsider the definition of leadership, not only as a company but also as a broader society. It's impossible to separate the impact of society's influence from our perspective. In rethinking how we define leadership, we also learn how to appreciate the ways leadership presents itself in different people.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/chiara.jpg] [alt:Chiara Antonucci Designer at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"Women have different experiences due to their gender and as a result, we've had to fight more in the workplace just to earn a seat at the table. Having more women in leadership isn't just beneficial because it empowers other women, it also raises awareness for men. Pitch is not afraid to put women into leadership positions. I love that some of our founders are female. It gives me hope and encourages me in my own path.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/dovile.jpg] [alt:Dovile Sandaite Software Engineer at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"The main prerequisite for thriving in the workplace is a gender-neutral mindset. It’s important to bring our unique perspectives to the table, and while some may be shaped by gender differences, ultimately, we all are here with the same goal: to solve problems. I try to focus on what connects me to both my male and female colleagues, rather than what differentiates us.\n\nI feel very lucky to be part of the team where me being a woman is not something that crosses my mind on a daily basis, and I can just focus on learning new things and growing in my career.\"\n\n## Enable a culture of flexibility, balance, and career growth\n\nGiving women something to lean on is as important as telling them to lean in. Women leave the tech industry for many reasons, one of the main ones is a lack of support. We don't just want women to build their careers with us, we want them to know and feel supported while doing so. It starts with giving proper recognition and making career opportunities accessible to women.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lu.jpg] [alt:Lu Yu Senior Brand Designer Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"When my opinions and ideas are listened to and respected I feel empowered to do more. I feel proud to be part of building such an exciting product and brand. On the other hand, I also feel supported and backed up by the company. Everyone is encouraging and self-motivated, which inspires me to be proactive and do my best work.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/kave.jpg] [alt:Kave Bulambo Senior Talent Acquisition Manager at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"Women often face the dilemma of choosing between being a parent or having a career. As a working mom, it's always been important for me throughout my career to be able to work without sacrificing the parent that I am. Having to choose between either/or is a disadvantage that ultimately influences our future earning potential and the contributions we are able to make to our families. Organizations should facilitate a remote and flexible work culture that allows parents to thrive in their careers and at home.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/frida.jpg] [alt:Frida Arvanitaki Legal Assistant at Pitch] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n\"I joined Pitch while still a student, and having the flexibility to work and study at the same time showed the company cares about my long-term success. I feel Pitch invests in me as much as I invest in them as I'v been able to gain knowledge and experience that will be useful throughout my career. I know that my contributions are valued by the feedback and recognition I receive from leadership. A culture of honest communication, openness, and flexible working hours make all of us motivated to show our best self and work.\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a company that aims to [build a truly inclusive environment](https://pitch.com/blog/13-slide-decks-for-inclusive-culture), we make a conscious effort to be mindful of the different ways people experience work as we build our teams and company.

They’ve worked on creative briefs, rebrands, and growth projects to drive breakout success for companies like Nike, Zenefits, and Paddle. The agency is chock-full of creatives — but that doesn’t mean everyone’s a graphic designer.\n\nThe thing is, presentations are Butchershop’s currency. Decks are how the agency brings ideas to life internally, and how they deliver work to clients. So being able to design a beautiful deck is important.\n\nTrevor Hubbard, Butchershop’s CEO, was frustrated. He and the team were using Google Slides to create presentations, but the interface “obviously wasn’t created with an eye for aesthetics.“ Decks were constantly getting lost in the Drive, and for the nondesigners on the team, making attractive presentations involved multiple people to assemble, write, and design the content. \n\nWith Pitch, Trevor found, anyone can easily mimic the qualities of a great designer. The UI is intuitive and inspiring, so every member of the team can create a sleek deck — and have fun in the process — whether it’s for a final deliverable or just to update each other internally. Keeping presentations organized and consistent is also effortless with folders and the fact that everything’s in the cloud.\n\nNow, there’s even some friendly competition over who’s making the coolest decks. The bottom line, says Trevor, is that “Pitch enables creative companies to communicate their ideas better.”\n\n## **Driving engagement in the marketing funnel**\n\nFounded by renowned product leader Ravi Mehta, [Outpace](https://www.outpace.co/) provides professionals with guided career development programs to help them rise to the ranks of the world’s top performers.\n\nMichelle Kwok, their Head of Community Growth, has been creating decks in Pitch since it was in beta, “for everything I possibly can”: Take-home assignments. Cover letters. Acquisitions. Birthdays. Content marketing. Speaking engagements. You name it — she’s done it in Pitch. So when Michelle joined Outpace and saw their existing Canva deck, she knew Pitch could elevate the team’s design.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1682700481/1Million_Outpace_inline_video.mp4] [poster:] [caption:Outpace uses Pitch to create lead magnet decks that are embedded on their website.] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe team was impressed and quickly adopted Pitch. The decks they’ve since created have become an important acquisition channel in their marketing strategy. They’re often transformed into lead magnets, as an innovative way of collecting prospects’ contact information — and tracking their engagement. “I like using Pitch for lead magnets,” Michelle says, “because you can see how many views you’re getting and when you’re getting them.” \n\nOnce the team has done the hard work of collating the research and writing the content, putting the decks together in Pitch is a breeze; they already have beautiful templates that keep everything consistent. “It’s game-changing for us,” notes Ravi. “We haven’t even thought about going back. Pitch is more powerful, easier to use, and more collaborative.”\n\n## **Building (and maintaining) consistent branding**\n\nAs an executive recruitment firm for hyper-growth and VC-backed companies, [Daversa Partners](https://www.daversapartners.com/) has worked with thousands of well-known brands. Decks are a key part of their communication toolkit, and it’s important that the materials they share are unified in look and feel. But the company has nearly 200 employees across 15+ teams. So how do they stay consistent? \n\nWith Keynote, that was impossible — creating decks together was “painful,” says Nicole Daversa, VP of Marketing and Communications. It wasn’t user friendly and hampered collaboration. Inevitably, the teams’ decks all looked different and lacked cohesion. To address this issue, a lot of precious time was spent on internal training and troubleshooting design issues. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Pitch has been life-changing. It has helped us optimize our teams’ workflows and strengthen brand cohesiveness across all our marketing channels.”] [footer:Nicole Daversa, Daversa Partners] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nDaversa adopted Pitch across the entire firm to foster better collaboration and further brand unity. Now, Pitch is so ingrained into their workflows that it has become a training touchpoint for new starters. \n\nWith their teams using branded templates from the get-go, they can deliver a consistent identity and style, even as they simultaneously work across dozens of verticals. “Pitch has been life-changing,” says Nicole. “It has helped us optimize our teams’ workflows and strengthen brand cohesiveness across all our marketing channels.”\n\n## **Tracking the impact of commercial proposals**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/3cad4036-4592-43b9-b738-d95084e7b099\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:Myth's reference deck includes information about the team, their work, and key services.] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith a small but mighty team of 8, animation house [Myth](https://www.mythstudio.co.uk/) has created visual assets for some big companies, including Budweiser, Fanta, and Mars. Agency life involves sending out proposal decks to lots of prospective clients, and Google Slides wasn’t cutting it. \n\nThe team’s main annoyance? They couldn’t send a single proposal to multiple prospects. Instead, they had to duplicate their reference deck hundreds of times so potential clients wouldn’t see each other’s contact details. This wasn’t just time-consuming and messy; it also posed a GDPR risk if things got mixed up. There had to be a better way.\n\nThere are a number of reasons Jimmy Gordon, Myth’s Business Development Director, loves Pitch: the “healthy” GIF size limit, handy collaboration features, and “tip-top customer service.” But custom links are what really stole his heart: “As soon as I saw the Share button, it was an instant yes for me. Custom links have been a game changer.” \n\nThe team now creates all their commercial decks in Pitch through a streamlined process: Jimmy builds the basis of a proposal from a template, their producer drops in costs, and their creative director fills in the design content. They can securely send decks to multiple prospects using separate passcode-protected links, and can analyze the impact with presentation analytics — all while keeping their workspace nice and neat.\n\n## **Empowering a scaling sales team**\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1711114398/blog/1%20million%20teams/1Million_Primer_inline_video.mp4] [poster:] [caption:Primer’s scalable sales deck features embedded recordings that provide details, context, and personality.] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith [Primer](https://primer.io/), less is more. The no-code payments platform strives to be the simplest way for online businesses to build beautiful buying experiences for their customers. Their fully remote company operates across the globe, catering to clients from travel to retail to online gaming. \n\nChris Jacques, Head of Sales Enablement, works alongside a growing team of salespeople, a BDR, and solutions engineers who prize innovation, speed, and efficiency. They use decks internally for roadmaps, all-hands meetings, and training materials. And, of course, they use external-facing decks to sell their product in every phase of the cycle.\n\nAt the heart of their sales motion is a client-centric deck template that outlines the problems in the market and how Primer solves them. Chris worked with designers to build the template, which now serves as the blueprint for every sales deck at Primer, including RFPs, commercial proposals, and technical overviews.\\\n\\\n“The sales deck template makes it easier for my team to do their job,” says Chris. “I mean, click duplicate, think about what you're trying to go through with your merchant, delete the slides you don't need — and boom, you're ready for a presentation in an hour.” \n\nTo learn more about how Pitch helps Chris enable his sales team, [check out our latest customer story](https://pitch.com/blog/how-a-savvy-sales-team-primes-itself-for-success).\n\n## A million and you\n\nTeams like these have created one million workspaces in Pitch.

It’s time to give you a peek at what we’ve been up to and share what’s coming next in 2020.\n\nSince our founding, we've spoken to thousands of presentation creators and consumers. And we've learned a lot. Our biggest takeaway? Teams are tired of choosing between collaboration, efficiency, and aesthetics. You go to Google Slides when you need to work together, PowerPoint when you have to create something complex, and Keynote (or even Figma) when you want something to look great. But you can't do it all in one tool.\n\nNow you can. Pitch helps teams create, collaborate on, and distribute better presentations faster and more effectively than ever before. Take a look.\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RThmp6VclMQ?modestbranding=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Pitch is collaborative: Bring your team and their knowledge together\n\nCollaboration sits at the heart of Pitch. Whether it's working with your immediate team, another group, or a customer, you can communicate and get things done efficiently, using any of your favorite devices.\n\nIt all starts with your workspace — the central destination for you and your team's presentations. Folders let you organize decks for easy discovery. And smart notifications will let you know which ones need your attention. Before Pitch, our early users relied on multiple presentation tools, with different versions of files scattered in the cloud or lost on someone's desktop. Having everything in one place has been hugely impactful in keeping teams aligned and up to date.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/stealth-reveal-collaboration_ykoyii.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/ui-all-hands-on-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen it comes to sharing feedback, our features support real-world workflows. Leave comments, assign tasks, and share progress right from Pitch, without being intrusive or doing extra work. Imagine a project management system embedded in your presentation software.\n\n## Pitch is gorgeous: Create beautiful, on-brand presentations, no matter your design skills\n\nEveryone wants their work to look good, but let's face it: Most of us aren't designers. Pitch enables teams to quickly create presentations that are beautiful and stay true to their brand.\n\nAll you need are your colors and fonts. Add them to Pitch and create your first template in minutes. Now, when your colleague in sales wants to work with a presentation, they won't need to install fonts or double-check a style guide. They’ll always have the latest assets at their fingertips. As your brand evolves, you can easily update your styles and templates and immediately distribute them to your team.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/stealth-revealt-templates-styles_ymsdng.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/ui-all-hands-on-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you don't have a template just yet, you can start with one of ours. We’ve created dozens of [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) that combine strong design with storytelling and support a variety of use cases, from [team meetings](https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Meeting-45H2Kk3yQrjX4R4aie6gxWZ2) to [SEO reporting](https://pitch.com/templates/SEO-Report-5xZdZD0FvgdS4mRDru3m5fGW). Now you can put together the perfect deck in record time.\n\n## Pitch is fast: Build presentations with speed and precision\n\n[Designing presentations](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips) using today's tools can be a struggle. It can take hours to make something that only looks halfway decent. Inspired by modern collaboration and design tools, we're redefining the experience of creating presentations.\n\nOur editing experience is fast, intuitive, and gets out of your way so you can focus on your message. Smart on-slide controls let you update content quickly without digging into menu options. Integrations from partners like Unsplash and Giphy enable you to source images, icons, or logos without opening a browser. In Pitch, there are no difficult-to-find features — **everyone can feel like a power user**.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/stealth-reveal-quick-menu_iyzimu.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/ui-all-hands-on-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe've also introduced more novel features, like our quick menu. Outline your deck, add and edit content, and share updates with others — all without leaving your keyboard. We want to help you make presentations as fast as you can think.\n\nAnd this is just Pitch today. We have an ambitious roadmap we're working through between now and launch, with a particular focus on these three areas:\n\n**Powerful integrations**: We're taking stale, static presentations and making them dynamic sources of information. Pitch will connect directly to the data you care about, so everyone has access to the latest numbers and news, without the hassle of manual updates. [Let us know](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/ziOO2z) which integrations are most important to you.\n\n**A place for sharing and discovery:** There are so many amazing ideas out there. We believe they should be available to and usable by everyone. We'll be introducing a way to get inspiration from others and publish your ideas to the world.\\\n\\\n**Cross-platform availability**: Pitch is for every type of presentation creator — whether you work in the office, on the go, or in the air. Today we're available on the web, macOS, and Windows, with apps that work both online and offline. Mobile apps are on the way.\n\n## Pitch is so much more: Our launch plans for 2020\n\nWe can’t wait to share Pitch with the world later this year! That being said, we don't have a planned launch date. Right now, our top priority is nailing the product experience with our beta users.\n\nThis month, we're onboarding our largest group: 250 teams! Scaling our beta in a controlled way lets us test hypotheses and process findings. Here's what the next several months will look like:\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/stealthreveal_post_rollout_big.jpg] [alt:Scaling our beta in a controlled way lets us test hypotheses and process findings.

Make sure you’re on our waitlist. By April, we'll be sending out invites to new teams every week.\n\nI want to close by thanking everyone who's expressed interest in Pitch and what we're building. To our beta users: Thank you for your pioneering spirit and ongoing feedback. To those on our waitlist: Thank you for your belief in us, your enthusiasm, and your patience. You're much closer to experiencing Pitch than you think — stay tuned!

As a Senior Product Designer, I was involved in the initial planning phases for the release; our user interface was going to be a very visible part of Pitch 2.0. That meant identifying cracks in our UI and assessing the current software landscape, where design excellence is constantly pushed to new heights by tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/) and [Craft](https://www.craft.do/). It was the perfect time to take Pitch’s product visual language to the next level.**\n\nAfter all, let’s face it: Pitch was dwelling in a murky grey borderland, drowning in dividers and sections (hence our internal project name, “borderless design”). That said, we never set out to fully reimagine the product. We follow a strict design philosophy at Pitch, where every new feature has to be worth the space it takes up. We want to be a powerful, cutting-edge platform — not another presentation tool with thousands of menu options \\*cough\\*.\n\nThe redesign was a timely update to help our product continue to stand tall against the backdrop of modern software. And this is your backstage pass to the creative chaos, meticulous tweaks, and strategic decisions that birthed the sleeker, more sophisticated Pitch you see today.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702458808/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/1_an_explorative_approach.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Taking an explorative approach\n\nAt Pitch, we believe collaboration is the backbone of innovation — so we kicked things off by getting everyone on the team to explore and play with visual styles. This helped us understand where individual designers saw potential to evolve Pitch’s visual language, and where we all stood on what “modern software” looks like. Ultimately, this approach also served as a fun way to get everyone involved in the project.\n\nSimultaneously, we did a teardown of the existing visual design. We plastered hundreds of stickies over our key screens, highlighting inconsistencies, eye sores, and anything else that made us cringe. Armed with the insights from this exploration, we established two guiding principles: **simplify** and **modernize**. This wasn’t about tossing everything out; we were embarking on a calculated evolution.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702458803/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/2_starting_with_the_grid.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Starting with the grid\n\nThe grid is the heart of any UI. It defines how elements are sized and how they’re spaced apart, and enables a cohesive rhythm and flow for content.\n\nBut our flow was off. Buttons and interactions were small and hidden. We wanted a more open and friendly feeling, so we shifted from a 6px to an 8px grid. That might sound minor, but it paved the way for a cascade of improvements.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“This wasn’t about tossing everything out; we were embarking on a calculated evolution.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOur buttons and inputs went from 30px to 32px. We rounded corners just a tad more. Toggles and checkboxes got bigger. And in many places we reduced sizing and padding to accommodate content. One seemingly small shift allowed us to make incremental changes to all our elements — and be more in sync with the Pitch brand.\n\n## Tightening up the typography\n\nThe Pitch app has always relied on two typefaces: Lato and our brand font, Mark Pro. Lato is primarily used for body and headline copy, while Mark Pro is reserved for main page titles.\n\nBut the size contrast between Lato and Mark Pro was huge, so the titles felt overpowering and disconnected from the rest of the app. By tweaking our type scale and extending the brand font into the editor, we made our typography more approachable and streamlined titles into the overall design scheme.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702458802/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/4_neutralizing_the_blues.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Neutralizing the blues\n\nOur action color needed a makeover. Not only was this color different to what our overall brand and website were using — drowning everything in blue was so *yesterday*.\n\nActing in line with our goal to simplify, we neutralized a lot of interactive elements in the menu as well as lower priority buttons. Then we used the action color to highlight important items, which better guides users’ attention and creates a calmer and more focused UI.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702458802/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/5_creating_crisper_borders.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Creating crisper borders\n\nAs a creator tool, our UI lives alongside all types of colors and backgrounds; it’s natural for the UI to overlap with the canvas at times. But our solid border colors — fuzzy and muddy — were a sore point.\n\nWe tackled this by switching to transparent colors and using shadow rings to create the borders. Now, instead of awkwardly crowding the popovers, the borders gracefully fall outside the elements. They’re noticeable on light backgrounds, but seamlessly blend into darker colors.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702458806/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/6_building_bolder_icons.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Building bolder icons\n\nOur original icons, crafted by the talented [Martin David](https://twitter.com/srioz), paved the way for where we are today. But as we added more custom icons over the years, some became misaligned, improperly sized, and caught up in complex metaphors.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to align with a brand that’s grown and become bolder, we revamped the icons. We embraced simpler shapes and common metaphors for instant recognition. After exploring various styles, we settled on a 1.5px stroke, adding weight and visual significance to our icons.\n\nThese icons were designed in a tight window. We’ll continue to iterate on them, making sure to keep things fresh and aligned with our evolving brand.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1702467234/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/7B_simplifying_the_editor_toolbar.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Simplifying the editor toolbar…\n\nIn our pursuit of simplicity, we decided to revamp one of the core areas in the editor — the toolbar.\n\nOver the years, custom buttons and overrides had cluttered the space, creating confusion, inconsistencies, and a puzzling hierarchy.\n\nWe smoothed out the complexity by unifying button styles, prioritizing key actions, introducing a more accessible menu button, and smartly tweaking the order in which they appear.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1702458801/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/8_and_the_dashboard_layout.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## …and the dashboard layout\n\nIn our bid for visual perfection, we didn’t stop at the surface; we made impactful changes in the dashboard layout itself. The previous setup — with five components, tangled sidebars, and headers — lacked clarity and carried unnecessary visual baggage.\n\nWe distilled the layout down to just two columns, and grouped crucial navigation items together. We also implemented common patterns for workspace switching, and positioned titles higher up in the viewport.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1702474151/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/actions-light.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Elevating key actions\n\nWith the introduction of our [AI presentation generator](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-pitch-2-0), we knew we needed to more clearly signpost the multiple ways users could start creating a deck. As we bid farewell to the title bar in the dashboard, we embarked on a quest for the optimal spot to showcase these options.\n\nWe’d previously explored having a row of action buttons, and decided this would be a good time to see it through. This solution allowed us to highlight multiple key actions, and inject some subtle but delightful interactions in the process. The additional options moved down one level: Clicking on **Start new presentation** now reveals the more specific options to **Start from blank** and **Import file** alongside the available templates.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1702474847/blog/A%20behind-the-scenes%20look%20at%20the%20product%E2%80%99s%20redesign/Final_comp_1.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Bringing it all together\n\nWhen you weave all these changes together, you get a Pitch that's more elegant and less noisy. Elements are easier to find, and content is a breeze to scan. Don’t just take my word for it: Since launching Pitch 2.0 (almost exactly) one month ago, there’s been a **31% increase** in [quick menu](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4287519-navigate-pitch-faster-using-the-quick-menu) usage, a **1088% increase** in [visits to the Library](https://pitch.com/blog/manage-your-brand-in-the-library), and a whopping **1481% jump** in users [uploading Library assets](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6010928-save-assets-to-your-workspace-library).\n\nThese results are a testament to the collaborative effort of our talented team, and I couldn’t be prouder of where we’ve landed with our refined visual design. With a tight timeline, the team went above and beyond to deliver the improvements. We’ve laid a solid foundation, and are eagerly looking forward to building on it and crafting new, future-focused features.\n\nA special shout-out to [Adam Gamble](https://linkedin.com/in/adam-gamble-118401220), [Aneliya Kyurkchiyska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneliya-kyurkchiyska/), [Anton Volkov](https://twitter.com/anton_volkoff?lang=en), [Brendan Donovan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfdonovan/), [Eric Labod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericlabod/?originalSubdomain=de), [Kathryn Lawrence](http://kathrynisabelle.com/), and [Tom Bogner](https://twitter.com/dastom?lang=en)!

To keep your teamwork in sync, you need these channels to talk to each other. That’s why today, we're introducing our new Pitch app for Slack.**\n\nIt’s easy to create together in Pitch: You can mention your teammates in comments, assign them slides, or marshal progress with slide statuses. But when your teammates close Pitch, how can you drive your presentation forward? They might see an email notifying them of updates — if they check their email (for me, that happens once a day at most). Likewise, continuing a discussion in Slack can make it difficult for others to stay in the loop. \n\nWith the [Pitch app for Slack](https://app.pitch.com/app/preferences/notifications), your team always has a clear overview of a deck’s status and knows when and where they’re needed. They can see slide previews, comments and mentions, invitations to decks and workspaces, and notifications about slide assignments — all right in Slack. \n\n## Catch your teammates’ eyes with presentation previews\n\nLet’s face it: Slides are better showcased with eye-catching images than simple links. When you share your presentation in Slack, it now displays a large preview of the slide you’ve linked. Your whole team can catch a glimpse of your beautiful deck, whether you’re asking them to create slides, leave a comment, or review your latest thinking. These previews are even visible to colleagues who haven’t yet signed up for Pitch, making it easier to share your work with any team.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668505011/blog/Work%20on%20your%20decks%20together%20in%20Slack/1_Inline_image_Work_on_your_decks_together_in_Slack_w1200.jpg] [alt:A comment in Slack linking to a Pitch presentation now displays an expanded preview of the deck.] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’ve always got our eye on security, though, and this release is no different. To protect your private work, presentation links in Slack only display a preview when they’re shared by someone with access to the deck.\n\n## Streamline conversations with quick replies\n\nTeams often comment on specific slides to make design suggestions, leave feedback on content, ask for input, or pull an expert into the conversation. But when your team lives in Slack, there’s a chance the recipient won’t see the comment for a while.\n\nThe Pitch app for Slack makes conversations more connected and visible. When you receive a mention or comment in Pitch, it creates a new conversation under Apps in the Slack sidebar. The comment appears alongside a preview of the relevant slide, so you get the full context of the message. Even better? You can fire off a reply directly from Slack, so you’re always able to reach — and be reached by — your teammates, even when they don’t have the presentation open.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668505011/blog/Work%20on%20your%20decks%20together%20in%20Slack/2_Inline_image_Work_on_your_decks_together_in_Slack_w1200.jpg] [alt:A Slack notification of a Pitch comment with the Reply option.] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Accept invitations to work on new decks\n\nThe Pitch app for Slack lists all the invitations you’ve received, whether they’re requests to collaborate on a presentation or join another Pitch workspace. When a new invitation pops up, you can quickly accept it with one click. Then, you can jump straight into the fun stuff and start creating stunning decks with your teammates. \n\nAlong with invitations, you’ll also see any slides that have been assigned to you. A preview image of the slide will show up too. This means you can instantly judge the work involved — does the slide need to be created from scratch or just given some design polish?\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668505011/blog/Work%20on%20your%20decks%20together%20in%20Slack/3_Inline_image_Work_on_your_decks_together_in_Slack_w1200.jpg] [alt:A notification in Slack indicating that a Pitch slide has been assigned.] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Stay connected with your team\n\nWe believe teams should be able to choose the best tools for every problem — and that they shouldn’t have to worry about disjointed workflows. Earlier this year, we launched a [Notion](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5994920-share-live-presentations-in-notion) integration, and we’re delighted to follow it with [the Pitch app for Slack](https://app.pitch.com/app/preferences/notifications).

[Why mess with something that’s already working, you might ask](https://pitch.com/blog/why-we-redesigned-pitch-before-we-launched)?\n\nWell, in some ways, the time had come. While we were among the first SaaS companies to popularize the sort of 3D illustrations Pitch became known for, as the style grew in popularity, we wanted to evolve to the next stage of what would make Pitch visually distinct. We wanted to stand out, not blend in. And more than that, we wanted to pave the way for what's next and play a part in setting the trends in the design world. \n\nWe also wanted to build a broader design language that thoughtfully considered how our visual assets played together and contributed to our wider brand messaging. It was important to us to stay true to our original design style while building a cohesive identity that could scale with us. In essence, to mature the brand while still keeping its fun and playfulness.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Motion_3D_slides_xfzqcp.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Motion_3D_slides.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Making Pitch an iconic brand\n\nIn our early discussions, the question came up time and time again: What makes a brand iconic? When we thought of brands that were iconic to us, they shared a few defining aspects: They were simple. They were classic. They were bold. \n\nBut more than that, they really resonated with their fans. They intuitively understood what was important to people at that time, and they stuck with their gut and weren’t afraid to make bold choices based on this. They were memorable, not only because of their distinct color scheme or beautiful fonts, but because they continuously evolved in line with their audience and users. They didn’t stagnate, didn’t compromise. They were constantly raising the bar for themselves as well as the industry. \n\n“When you look around, it’s clear that we’re in the midst of this new wave trend in SaaS software: Modern teams want modern brands. And today, the value of brand to a business is unparalleled. In a world of commodities, brand is now the major differentiator,” our CMO Thom Cummings says.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nPitch as a company — and as a brand — is centered on collaboration.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’ve built our product to meet the needs of modern teams, teams like ours. And part of that collaborative spirit is about having fun, but it’s also about how we can enable people to do their best work, better. And at the end of the day, we believe in building delightful products. So, how do we turn that from marketing speak into tangible visual assets? \n\nWe’ve been really lucky to have an incredible crew of super talented designers who have helped us build a distinct and recognizable brand at such a young stage in our company. When Anna and Arek Kajda, our illustrators, began working on the first version of the Pitch website, no one had any idea how much it would take off. At a time when much of web design was focused on flat or isometric illustrations, Pitch made a bold decision to go in a new direction.\n\n“We weren’t sure how it would be received originally,” Anna and Arek explained. “Whenever you try something different, it’s always a risk. But once we started seeing the positive feedback, we knew we were onto something.”\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/3_Big_image_w1200_-_Pitch_brand1_Love_u4b5nk.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/3_Big_image_w1200_-_Pitch_brand1_Love.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“We knew we had hit upon something that was working with the 3D characters and wanted to make sure it was carried with us to the next stage in our brand development,” Anna and Arek explain. “We did, however, want to explore a more mature style in terms of proportions, colors, and possible situations interacting with the UI.”\n\nTogether, our in-house design and brand team, in collaboration with the team from [DesignStudio](https://design.studio/), set off on a journey to create a longer-term vision of what the Pitch brand could become. For our latest brand evolution, we used explorations from that project that incorporate elements of DesignStudio's recommendations. \n\n## Sliding into the next phase of our brand\n\nIt's always important to stay close to your core, and for us, the 3D illustrations and characters were central to how people had grown to know Pitch. But in order to grow up, you need to evolve.\n\n“One of the core questions we wanted to answer was: How we would use our 3D illustrations in a strategic and thoughtful way?” Lu Yu, our Senior Brand Designer, explains. “Why do we choose to use 3D in some objects and not others? What does it represent for us as a brand?”\n\nAnother question was how 3D illustrations would work alongside product shots and UI. For years, we’d kept the UI under wraps but now, we’d be able to build a brand that integrated these elements as well. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nThat’s where the slides come in.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOne of the big changes we made was making slides an integral part of our brand language. Slides — apart from being the key ingredient from which all presentations are made — also served a strategic purpose in our design. They were a core, ownable object that represented the Pitch app itself. Now, the question was how, exactly, we would build them into our brand.\n\nEvery presentation starts with a single slide. But then it evolves and grows, gaining momentum with new content and collaborators.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/1_Slide_progression_beyondTB_wbihtw.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/1_Slide_progression_beyondTB.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen we discussed how we would show the story aspect of a presentation visually, we considered a few concepts. We wanted to show motion and direction, but in a way that didn't feel too limited or abstract. Presentations move work forward, but they themselves are not linear. They're dynamic and flow the same way ideas do. \n\nWe continued to experiment with colors and textures until we created a representation of the slides we felt resonated with us, one that was inclusive and friendly, while also being clean and elegant.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Big_image_w1200_-_Homepage_visual_smaller.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Character development 101: Evolving our illustration style\n\nEveryone got the concept of slides being the metaphor, the main discussions were around how the slides should actually behave and blend with the other brand assets. As we continued to refine the slide concept, we still felt we hadn’t totally nailed how they would interact with the characters themselves. We wanted their interactions to be clear but not overwhelming. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Small_image_w800_-_Sketches.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“Pitch’s illustration style is colorful and friendly, but not in a childish way. It’s definitely playful, yet also very refined,” Lu explains.\n\nWe needed to bridge the gap between the playfulness of the characters and the more sleek feel of the new concepts, so we tried to achieve something that could work together, experimenting with different ways to show how they could potentially interact with slides.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/2_Sketches_beyondTB_qb3z4y.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/2_Sketches_beyondTB.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:image [src:] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Viva la chubby hands! \n\nAt the end of the day, we had to remind ourselves not to go too far from what people knew and loved about us. We wanted to stay close to the feedback we’d gotten from users and our community about what aspects of Pitch they found delightful.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Big_image_w1200_-_Chubby_hand_evolution.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNot only do we have a more mature visual style now, but we have also thoughtfully considered how our brand should be represented in everything from animations and sound to copywriting and messaging.\n\n\"From engaging visuals for social media to playful educational content, motion brings our brand to life. By seamlessly combining 3D and and 2D animations, we created a motion language that’s unique as well as scalable to multiple form factors,\" Tom Bogner, our Product \u0026 Motion Designer explains. \"Much like our illustrations, the animation curves follow simple but meticulously crafted geometric paths. With snappy easing curves combined with modern percussive sound design makes sure every animation we put out reflects our brand: Playful and elegant at the same time.\"\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/4_introanimation_v2_pim4qc.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/4_introanimation_v2.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPitch is building uncompromisingly good presentation software. As a company, we want to raise the bar for what people expect, both from their presentation tools as well as from the brands they love. When we look at the ecosystem around us, we’re constantly impressed and humbled by the amazing products that are being built.

Our brand new integration with ChartMogul makes it fast and easy to share your business’ performance with stakeholders who need to know — right within Pitch. \n\nWhether growth is ahead of schedule or off track, shareholders, employees, and the board want to know what’s going on and why. For leaders of product-led SaaS businesses, offering a clear-cut explanation isn’t always easy, and even a strong quarter can turn into a tricky discussion. Founders need their revenue reports to work for them, and to be able to display the latest figures with ease.\n\nToday, we’re launching a new integration with ChartMogul to help you import revenue data into Pitch charts and report on your SaaS metrics in the context of your branded presentation. Together, we aim to take the pain out of revenue reporting and foster richer conversations around the metrics that drive a company’s most important decisions. With this integration, teams can report on SaaS revenue metrics directly from Pitch and [share beautiful reports](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports) with colleagues, investors, and other partners. \n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-B_0TSEAMA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## How to build revenue reports with impact\n\nWhat’s the key to a successful revenue report? An accurate, transparent view into your metrics, the right context for your audience, and easy access for stakeholders who want to refer back asynchronously. \n\nHere’s how to build revenue reports that have the right impact, and how our latest integration can help supercharge your reporting workflow. \n\n### 1. Know your metrics\n\nTo succeed in SaaS, you need to be comfortable digging into the data to understand the dynamics impacting business growth.\n\nMetrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR), annual run rate (ARR), and average revenue per account (ARPA) help you highlight revenue growth. These show how you're succeeding at acquiring, converting, and expanding your customer base.\n\nChurn rates and customer lifetime value (LTV) are indicators for retention. Spikes or dips in these metrics can alert you to issues with pricing, product, or customer support. Tackling these is imperative if you want to increase your rate of revenue growth over time. \n\nTogether, these metrics help you better understand both how fast you're growing, as well as the factors that could limit your long-term success. All of these and more are available via our new integration.\n\nWhen framing your data, just be sure to ask yourself: Who needs to know, and how will they benefit most from knowing? In many cases, it’s better to focus the discussion around just a few of these metrics, so you spend time diagnosing issues, asking for support, and making plans to act.\n\n### 2. Add the right context \n\nNumbers alone don’t tell a story. It’s critical to map revenue and growth to the real-world journey users go through within your product. Multimedia — like images, videos, and screenshots of feedback — can help others understand the context behind changes in your funnel. \n\nIn this way, presentations are the perfect medium for helping everyone derive insight from data. They’re flexible by nature: You can show the top insights stakeholders need for at-a-glance understanding of the overall situation, while adding on whatever level of detail you need for drilling into the details. And, with the added layer of multimedia visuals, you can add a more robust narrative to your numbers.  \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nNumbers alone don’t tell a story. It’s critical to map revenue and growth to the real-world journey users go through within your product.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 3. Make it easy for everyone to access\n\nAnswering tricky questions about growth isn’t always fun, but what’s worse? An important stakeholder who didn’t get the slides. Whether you’re still refining your report or presenting the final figures, you need to ensure you get the right eyes on [your reports](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports) at the right time. \n\nUsing Pitch, you can make sure everyone can see and understand revenue numbers, even if they don’t have access to data tools like ChartMogul or use them on a daily basis. Invite key stakeholders to the deck and let them digest the report in their own time. They can share their questions in comments, making it easy to keep all relevant conversations in one place. \n\nAnd for your peace of mind that your deck made the rounds, you can double-check who saw the report with [presentation views](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5132455-see-who-has-looked-at-a-presentation-with-views) (available for Pitch Pro members only). \n\n### **4. Keep it consistent**\n\nBuild familiarity among your audience with the data by showing similar charts and slides over time, and the quality of your discussions around growth will improve. One way you can keep your reports consistent over time is by using [templates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports). So, we’ve partnered with ChartMogul to create a free template that shows their key charts in action. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/63e30ed3-8245-4ed9-9d74-ce962d67cbfb?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Start working with our investor update template](https://pitch.com/templates/SaaS-Investor-Update-0QRNi75EKgk45kZQTv6iNbQQ) to streamline your revenue reporting. \n\n## Introducing the Pitch \u0026 ChartMogul integration\n\nWe’re building Pitch to help you spend time where it matters most. That means less time copying and pasting between destinations and more time analyzing and discussing your work. \n\nSince our launch, customers have told us that they love using Pitch for their most important presentations, like [pitch decks](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks), [board decks](https://pitch.com/templates/Board-Deck-5WNEjL4zD9815VDStw4Vt6SS), and [company-wide updates](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Professional). \n\nThis integration was the natural next step. ChartMogul helps teams around the world stay on top of their SaaS revenue metrics, and this integration will provide users with a seamless way to represent their ChartMogul data in dynamic, beautiful presentations. \n\n“I'm incredibly excited about this integration as it automates something I've been doing manually for the past year, and it does it in a very elegant way,” says Nick Franklin, ChartMogul's CEO and founder.\n\n“We transitioned the whole team at ChartMogul onto Pitch and away from Google Slides and Keynote about a year ago. A big benefit for us is that we’ve seen the aesthetic bar for internal and external presentations raised across the company — it's just really hard to make an ugly-looking deck with Pitch.”\n\nWe offered a few SaaS founders an early look. Here's what they had to say: \n\n\u003e \"Having the option to pick any ChartMogul report with any time range and port it over to Pitch is a huge time-saver.” — Glenn Rogers, CEO \u0026 founder of [Float](https://www.float.com/) \n\u003e\n\u003e \"The integration with Google Sheets and ChartMogul is really powerful for our weekly all-hands meeting.

In this article, we’ll walk you through the nuts and bolts of building a pitch deck — slide by slide — using [successful startup decks](https://pitch.com/blog/15-great-pitch-decks-from-successful-startups) and popular template examples as a benchmark.\n\n## 6 essential components of a pitch deck\n\nNo matter what stage of funding your company is at, your [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/use-cases/pitch-decks) will need to cover each of these topics:\n\n1. Your mission or vision\n2. The problem you’re solving\n3. The market size of the opportunity\n4. Your product — and what makes it unique\n5. Traction and revenue\n6. Evidence that your team can execute\n\nYour pitch presentation should also back up each topic with hard data and insights, and show proof that people are willing to pay for your product. The goal is to strike a balance between providing evidence that instills investor confidence and piquing their interest with the vision for your business’s future.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nDon’t try to cram everything into the pitch deck. Your aim should be to get investors’ attention.] \\[cta-label:] \\[cta-href:] \\[photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668009991/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/Will-Dean-MBE.jpg] \\[name:Will Dean MBE] \\[role:CEO and Co-founder] \\[company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668086547/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/Testimonial-logos_ImmersiveGamebox.png] \\[layout:regular] \\[spacingTop:true] \\[spacingBottom:true] \\[spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### How many slides does your pitch deck need? \n\nThe best pitch decks are concise and use just a single slide to explain each topic. That said, it's important not to cram too much information onto each slide. You don’t need to limit yourself to a specific number of slides — but [aim for 10 rather than 40](https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1589603550178422784?s=20\u0026t=kY-RPuzv2EaTQZeH-alZ8Q). More importantly, be empathetic to your audience and consider the time it'll take for them to absorb the information.\n\nRemember, the people who are in the room when you present will have a different experience from those who view the deck async. You can prepare two versions — one pared-back version for presenting live and one version with more written commentary, or a [recording of you presenting](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) to send as a pre-read or follow-up. If you have any other detailed examples or notes, you can add an appendix for reference to keep the number of slides manageable.\n\n## The anatomy of a great pitch deck: Slide by slide\n\n### 1. Title slide and memorable one-liner\n\nYour first few slides are crucial — they’re how you’ll create a good first impression. So make sure your cover slide is polished and your tagline is both catchy and descriptive. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/1ed9aae9-76c8-46d8-b0a0-1970e72e36b0\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis pitch deck from [](https://pitch.com/u/tanja_perfeggt)[finance, baby!](https://pitch.com/u/financebaby) includes a great example of a title slide that’s simple, yet memorable. It introduces the company with an intriguing one-liner.\n\n### 2. The problem you’re solving\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668015096/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/start-up-pitch-deck-problem-slide.jpg] [alt:A slide from a pitch deck showing the what, why, and why now of a product. ] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMany of the best pitch decks dive straight into the problem. This gives the audience a clear starting point and helps put them in the shoes of your target customer. It also primes them to appreciate the impact of your product. \n\nUsually, the context slides also get into the more human side of the story. This [startup pitch deck template](https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd) visually highlights a typical user’s pain points. You can even add photos or diagrams, a persona, or a video of an actual customer. \n\n### 3. Market size and market fit\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/c6b7715b-08a7-4504-9104-5332930b6213/324f4e57-103f-46a4-aae3-4cf30963c1f7\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe next natural step in your story is to show the scale of the problem — and of the market opportunity. This second context slide should show data that indicates the size of your target market, the scope of the opportunity, and what returns potential investors can expect to get if they invest.\n\nThe last part of this section needs to explain why no other solution adequately addresses the problem right now. This sets your audience up for the next section: your product.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nWe love when a founder has an exceptional grasp of the market they're building. Competition is always present, so opinionated founders who are deeply embedded in the problem give us confidence in a partnership.] \\[cta-label:] \\[cta-href:] \\[photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668015486/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/kate-mcginn.jpg] \\[name:Kate McGinn] \\[role:Analyst] \\[company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668015504/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/seedcamp-logo-white.png] \\[layout:regular] \\[spacingTop:true] \\[spacingBottom:true] \\[spacingSize:large]}}\n\n### 4. Product and business model\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668015709/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/vc-pitch-deck-problem-slide.jpg] [alt:A slide from a pitch deck that describes how a product solves a user's problem. ] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/VC-Pitch-Deck-33Lsdq7J5Cg84ni9Fd632kB8] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/VC-Pitch-Deck-33Lsdq7J5Cg84ni9Fd632kB8] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s time to introduce your product. After the initial elevator pitch, some slide decks focus on the product’s key features to elicit an aha moment from investors like this slide from the [VC pitch deck template](https://pitch.com/templates/VC-Pitch-Deck-33Lsdq7J5Cg84ni9Fd632kB8). \n\nThe business model slide builds on the provided market context and the product’s unique value. It connects the two to show how a company will make money from potential customers — and why this particular business model best fits the product offering and customer need.\n\n### 5. Traction and revenue\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/54cc93b8-cf10-4483-b27d-0002abaed0e1/f59cd052-080d-44a3-9ad7-24ed2cdc1fea\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYour slide deck needs to prove that your business plan is not just an abstract idea but a viable, valuable strategy. While early-stage businesses (and even later stage companies in some industries) may not yet have revenue, there are other ways to show traction. These might include financial projections, user numbers, waiting lists, or early product engagement. \n\nThe bottom line is, you need to demonstrate that people are interested in the product — and that they’ll be willing to pay for it at some point. \n\nAlso be sure to include social proof: adoption by known brands, strategic and media partnerships, awards, press, and investment from recognized VCs or angel investors.\n\n### 6. Your team\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1668015707/blog/How%20to%20structure%20your%20pitch%20deck/async-pitch-deck-team-slide.jpg] [alt:A slide from a pitch deck showcasing the team behind the company. ] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Pitch-Deck-4eZnrJ38hgp65jWXha4xdJFp] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Pitch-Deck-4eZnrJ38hgp65jWXha4xdJFp] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s time to dedicate a slide to your awesome team. Use this slide from our [async pitch deck template](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Pitch-Deck-4eZnrJ38hgp65jWXha4xdJFp) to demonstrate your founding team's unique advantages — and what they can deliver. It could include information about any prior companies your team has founded as well as relevant industry experience.\n\n## Fundraising stages: Key points to highlight \n\nEvery pitch deck should tell a company’s story and convince the audience to come on board. But the stage of a business can change the way the story is told. We’ve highlighted some key points to focus on for each of the fundraising stages below:\n\n* **Pre-seed and seed-stage**: Focus on the founding team, market size, business plan, unique product solution, and social proof.\n* **Series A:** Showcase the team, unique product value compared to the competition, and early traction.\n* **Series B and above**: Demonstrate your traction, performance metrics, go-to-market plan, and ongoing product vision. \n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nIt’s important to understand which investors focus on your sector and your company stage.

Remember, fundraising is an iterative process. Even after you’ve signed off on your pitch deck, you’ll likely need to update it with new information or tailor it to a specific audience in the future.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage. When you start [pitching to investors](https://pitch.com/guides/pitching/how-to-pitch-your-business), their responses will inform how you improve your slides — you’ll tighten your storyline, remove unnecessary text, and add the data your audience consistently asks for. By integrating your learnings from this feedback loop into your deck in real time, you’re sure to land that term sheet offer faster than ever.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1644575677/use-case/presentation-maker/Mobile-App-Pitch-Deck.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Mobile-App-Pitch-Deck-4Eacbs2jnaM35Tyygi2VEZBJ\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1619690597/templates-grid/startup-pitch-deck.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more pitch decks] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch"],"title":"Our inclusion blunders — and what you can learn from them","visible-title":"Our inclusion blunders — and what you can learn from them","date":"2022-05-27T12:44:58.026Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Vanessa Stock","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655573/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-header-mobile_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655570/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-header-small_1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655566/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-header-mid_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655567/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-header-big_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655569/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-Cover_thumbnail_420x300_InclusionBL.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655570/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-blunders-Social_shareL.png","tweet-text":"In this post, we’re sharing a few experiences that have shaped our internal approach around diversity and inclusion.\n","teaser-text":"In this post, we’re sharing a few experiences that have shaped our internal approach around diversity and inclusion.","excerpt":"Over the last year, Pitch has doubled in size.

As our team has grown, so too has our understanding of the social responsibility we have when it comes to inclusion. \n\nInclusion has always been important to us as a company, but we know there is still a lot to do. We wanted to take a moment to reflect on what we've learned so far, so other companies can avoid stumbling where we tripped up.\n\nIn this post, we're sharing a few experiences that have shaped our internal approach around diversity and inclusion. For each scenario, we’ll outline what happened, the impact it had on teammates, and what factors companies can consider to improve their processes — and outcomes.\n\n## Do your due diligence when integrating company-wide tools\n\nRecently, Pitch introduced a company-wide tool to unify authentication for other tools like Slack and Personio. The goal was worthy, but we overlooked how names were handled in this context.\n\nWhen the tool was rolled out, it unintentionally used people’s legal names. This affected team members with dead names, longer names that are usually abbreviated, and reversed family and given names. A colleague from the LGBTQIA+ community raised the issue, which led to numerous microfrictions with every message and interaction. Imagine trying to tag someone and not being able to find them, or seeing a name that you don’t identify with pop up every time you’re tagged!\n\nWe worked with the colleague who raised the issue to address it. But the whole situation could have been avoided if we’d simply factored name handling into our vendor procurement and integration processes from the start. We’re using this opportunity to reflect on the limitations of current software tools through the lens of diversity and inclusion. Rather than think of “edge cases” as such, it’s important for all companies to design with the most vulnerable communities in mind.\n\n## Design recruitment to encourage diverse applicants\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655572/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-recruitment-diversity-and-inclusion-pledge_w1200.png] [alt:A screenshot of Pitch's Recruiting D\u0026I Pledge notion page.

The light-skinned hand in the far left has a rainbow wristband with a semi-colon tattoo. The hand beside is brown with a green mental health ribbon. On the right side, there is a black hand in a fist with a zipper cuff. On the far right, there is a brown hand holding a yellow lollipop with a purple ring in the middle (the intersex symbol), and a beaded wristband with the trans pride flag colors. ] [caption:A screenshot of Pitch's Recruiting D\u0026I Pledge] [layout:normal] [link:https://www.notion.so/pitch/Our-Recruiting-D-I-Pledge-fc35d4598aba4f26ac69628977656302] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen we redesigned our jobs page last year, we overlooked a basic consideration that makes a huge difference for candidates from diverse backgrounds: word choice.\n\nOur previous job descriptions weren’t attracting the quality of candidates we wanted. They had strongly gender-coded language and a long list of requirements. Through candidate feedback, we discovered that these factors were intimidating.\n\nWe decided to try something different — and noticed an immediate improvement. After changing the language used in the job description for a Frontend Engineer position, we had a 64% conversion rate compared to 29% for our next highest converting post. The applicants for that position were also incredibly qualified and inspiring individuals. \n\nOur recommendation for other companies is to focus on the basics. Run your job specifications through a gender decoder [like this one](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/), reduce the number of requirements for an initial application, and build a solid pipeline by proactively reaching out to diverse candidates. We don’t ask applicants to disclose identities but want to make sure we speak to them, so we now spend two weeks sourcing diverse candidates before opening a role to the public.\n\n## Be specific about diversity stats\n\nWe recently reported that we’ve seen an increase in diversity at Pitch over the last two years. However, as some teammates pointed out, the only diversity metric we track in our HR system is gender.\n\nBecause we value transparency, Pitch’s reports are available to the whole company. So the statistic prompted questions: What did the percentage increase in diversity really mean? Was the company assigning diversity-related labels to individuals without their knowledge? Had people missed out on opportunities to participate in a survey that captured this data? \n\nWe’d made the common misstep of having gender (in this case, mostly ciswomen) represent diversity overall. In the end, this word choice was solved in minutes by clarifying that the percentage increase only reflected the gender ratios in our HR system. \n\nBy being transparent about our available data, we can honestly address what we do and don’t know. At Pitch, we’re still figuring out how to strike the right balance between wanting to analyze and understand which groups are represented within our team and respecting people’s privacy. Our current solution, at least for recruitment, is to set up an interview journey with a variety of interviewers — and to offer candidates a chance to speak to Pitchers from similar communities at any point during the process. We also train hiring teams to remove [unconscious bias](https://pitch.com/presentations/Reducing-unconscious-biases-in-hiring-097TSM38NYwx4knmWo5aEFBy) as much as possible.\n\n## Have the difficult conversations before projects start\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655568/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-diversity-female-founded-startups-collection_w1200.png] [alt:A screenshot of Pitch's Female-Founded Startups pitch deck collection. Click on the image to proceed to the collection. The image has a dark banner with a gallery of faces. Underneath, there are six pitch decks.] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn March, we launched our [Female-Founded Startups pitch deck collection](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) as a way to profile thriving companies with female-identifying and nonbinary founders. Publicly, we achieved over 1.8 million views, received the support of influencers like [Karlie Kloss](https://twitter.com/karliekloss/status/1501291881925382148), and connected startups to interested investors and resources. Internally, we realized how difficult it was to work on social causes before we'd clarified our company’s position.\n\nWe started building our campaign messaging after the project was already underway. This resulted in a lot of tough conversations around key issues. A fundamental question — Who does Pitch count as female? — was raised but then left unanswered until we had to decide on the collection title. By then, we’d spoken to at least two openly nonbinary startup founders. They’d agreed to participate, knowing the campaign messaging was focused on International Women’s Day. \n\nHow would we choose a collection title without erasing their identities or alienating other influential partners? What terms should we use in our social media copy? We often had to answer these questions on the spot, when the focus should have been on campaign execution.\n\nThe public nature of the campaign forced us to reflect on accountability — how we thought literally determined what we published. And this prompted the challenging conversations that are necessary for companies to build open, resilient, and diverse teams. But our recommendation is to have these discussions over the course of months, not weeks!\n\n## Add checks to avoid overlooking cultural considerations\n\n[Building an inclusive environment](https://pitch.com/blog/13-slide-decks-for-inclusive-culture) in a remote culture creates hiccups all the time. With team members in many different time zones, we have to carefully consider how to conduct company events and frame holidays like our two-week, company-wide shutdown in December. \n\nIt's a continuous learning process for us, and sometimes we stumble. One example of this is when we sent out company T-shirts to everyone. After the fact, we were made aware that some of our teammates can't wear the color black for religious reasons. \n\nWhile we don't have a perfect checklist or formula to avoid these kinds of blunders, we do have some suggestions for how to be as culturally inclusive as possible. For instance, we use calendar tools to keep track of global cultural holidays. We also try to reduce meetings and focus on documentation so that everyone feels like they're part of the team regardless of their timezone. And we encourage team members to self-educate and gracefully accept critical feedback.\n\nIt's impossible to know everything. But by building a trusting company culture where people feel free to raise issues, you can learn from missteps and create an open dialogue.\n\n## How Pitch has moved forward\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1653655565/blog/diversity%20blunders/pitch-community-page_w1200.png] [alt:A screenshot of Pitch's Community page. Click on the image to go to the page. ] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/community] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn the past, Pitch has chosen to focus on quietly incorporating inclusion into our activities. We considered aspects of diversity when creating our illustrations, visual language, and digital sticker packs. We also activated features to learn candidate pronouns and name pronunciations during the recruitment process. But there’s more work to be done.\n\nThrough these experiences, we’ve learned how much we take for granted — and how what we take for granted can impact the whole team culture. It’s important to embrace unlearning as part of the growth process, and to recognize that inclusion is a practice and not a status. \n\nWe hope these scenarios provide other companies with the context to build a more inclusive future of work. And, in the spirit of sharing resources, here are three great reference decks: [We all have pronouns](https://pitch.com/presentations/We-all-have-pronouns-52yPJv5iEMK35KpGVE3aDgrn) by Rey (they/them), [Reducing unconscious biases in hiring](https://pitch.com/presentations/Reducing-unconscious-biases-in-hiring-097TSM38NYwx4knmWo5aEFBy) by Sara (she/her) and Anaïs (she/her), and [Pride 2.0 for companies](https://pitch.com/presentations/Pride-20-for-companies-3mM6mi2Fhr9x4Y9yDA0WWtdP) by Athena. \n\nCheck out our [](https://pitch.com/c/inclusion-at-work)[Inclusion at Work](https://pitch.com/c/inclusion-at-work) collection for more, and submit your deck through [this form](https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/YQen27Go?typeform-source=pitch.com#source=presentations\u0026medium=web\u0026campaign=2022_q2_publishing_beta) if you'd like to be included too!"},{"type":"blog","category":["News"],"title":"Don’t just present.

Without sacrificing on collaboration, aesthetics, or speed. \n\nAlong with today’s launch, we’re also introducing live video collaboration, a first-of-its-kind feature that builds on the seamless collaboration experience our customers already love. \n\n## Create together with live video collaboration\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://d3x4b1wy4qlu9.cloudfront.net/media/blog/pitch-launches/launch_collab_TeamMeeting_zgpidl.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/virtualoffsitefallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen we started Pitch, we set out to build the fastest and most collaborative way to create beautiful presentations. From the very beginning, we enabled teams to discuss ideas, co-create, delegate work, and track progress — all in one place. \n\nThe only thing you couldn’t do was chat face to face in Pitch. Until now. \n\nToday, we’re introducing live video collaboration. Start a video call directly in a presentation and work together in real time. Use it to discuss a deck, hold a team meeting, or simply have an informal chat. Live video collaboration generates the kind of spontaneous collaboration and free flow of ideas that many of us took advantage of when working in a shared space with our team.  \n\n## Design beautiful decks in record time\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://d3x4b1wy4qlu9.cloudfront.net/media/blog/pitch-launches/launch_Template_stylechange_tt11f5.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/virtualoffsitefallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThroughout our beta, customers raved about Pitch’s ease of use and the time they saved when creating new presentations. Every part of Pitch was crafted to help teams move quickly while improving the end result of their work, in particular: \n\n**Stylish and flexible templates**: We pride ourselves on creating templates that are beautiful, informative, and practical. Our [template gallery](https://pitch.com/templates) now has more than 40 custom-crafted templates built around visual themes and real-world use cases. With presentation styles, it takes literal seconds to customize our templates to make them look like yours. \n\n**A powerfully simple editing experience**: We designed our editor to be the fastest, most intuitive way to create presentations, [no matter your design skills](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips). And then we redesigned it to be even better. Working with Pitch feels new and unique while being familiar in all of the best ways. There’s no learning curve — just point, click, create. \n\n## Bring slides to life with powerful integrations\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://d3x4b1wy4qlu9.cloudfront.net/media/blog/pitch-launches/launch_GoogleAnalyticsBG_2_hpgypx.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/virtualoffsitefallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch connects seamlessly with a variety of sources to help every deck look its best. In addition to our current integrations, like Unsplash, Giphy, YouTube, and Loom, we’ve recently introduced support for Google Analytics and Google Sheets. Now you can easily create charts that are up-to-date and accurate without having to manually copy and paste information.\n\nThis is just the beginning. We’re already working on our next batch of integrations — Stripe, Typeform, and Mailchimp — and in 2021, we plan to open Pitch up to developers and partners who can build on top of Pitch. \n\n## Make next-level decks with Pitch Pro\n\nWith our launch, we’re officially introducing a free plan as well as our premium plan, Pitch Pro. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/launch_pro_pricing.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIdeal for individuals and small teams, our Starter plan is and will always be free. We don’t want to limit your team’s ability to make beautiful, on-brand decks; therefore each workspace comes with unlimited users, presentations, templates, and font uploads. \n\nPitch Pro is for power users and fast-growing teams that use presentations as a way to build their business. Core features include additional permissions, video uploads, and unbranded PDF exports. Pitch Pro costs $10 per user, per month. You can take a closer look at each plan [here](https://pitch.com/pricing). \n\n## Looking back on the past year\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about building a product, scaling our team, and processing customer feedback. We literally have thousands of entries on our product roadmap. There's still plenty we need and want to build, but we’ve made remarkable progress, [shipping 72 new features, 210 improvements, and 260 bug fixes](https://pitch.com/whats-new) throughout the course of our beta. \n\nOur team grew an incredible amount this year — from 60 to 90 while being fully remote. Our own product has become an essential tool for onboarding new hires and keeping teams connected. We have big ambitions for 2021 and beyond. If you’re ready for your next adventure, we’d love to hear from you! [Browse our jobs page](https://pitch.com/jobs) to see all available positions. \n\nHands down, the most rewarding part of this journey has been working with customers, who have been unbelievably generous with their time and attention. Knowing that our product is already helping teams work faster and more collaboratively has been unbelievably motivating. It gets us even more excited for everything we’re building. Here are a few examples of how Pitch is supporting teams of all sizes.  \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/launch_reviews.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## What’s next for Pitch?\n\nBuilding presentation software from the ground up is no easy feat. Since starting out, we’ve worked to balance laying the foundation with pushing the envelope for what modern presentation software can and should do. Over the next year, we’ll continue that approach while we work to:   \n\n**Support every device you create on**: Our iOS app is already in beta and will launch soon; Android will follow soon after. \n\n**Help you connect any type of idea**: We’re doubling down on media and data integrations to help bring your presentations to life. \n\n**Close the loop on receiving feedback**: Upcoming features like presentation analytics will make it easy to optimize your work without having to upload your decks to yet another piece of software. \n\nToday’s launch is the result of thousands of hours of conversations, brainstorming sessions, and meetings with presentation creators. We’ve worked to create something that can unlock your team’s best thinking and help you share that knowledge anywhere. But it’s just the start. As we continue building Pitch, we want to hear from you. We’re on this journey together, and we can’t wait to show you what’s next.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"A new look \u0026 new ways to collaborate","date":"2020-08-04T08:51:32.344Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/mobileheader_ramsrefresh.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/smallheader_ramsrefresh.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/midheader_ramsrefresh.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/bigheader_ramsrefresh.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/thumbnailRAMS.jpg","tweet-text":"We're unveiling Pitch's new look, and with it, new ways to collaborate \u0026 create presentations faster than ever:","teaser-text":"We're debuting a new look for Pitch, and with it, new ways to collaborate and create presentations faster than ever before.","excerpt":"Today we’re releasing our biggest update since entering beta last year.

It’s actually one that we’ve been quietly working on since September and it’s taken months of explorations, testing, and iterations to bring to life.\n\nWhen we started on this project, we had three main goals in mind:\n\n* Radically simplify the editing experience\n* Make feedback and collaboration top of mind\n* Improve the accessibility of templates and presentation styles\n\nWe’re confident this update will make designing, creating, and collaborating in Pitch simpler, without limiting what you and your team can build.\n\n## A more personalized workspace\n\nLike many of today’s leading collaboration tools, we use workspaces as a way to centralize your team’s work and facilitate sharing and discovery. What we’ve been missing is a mini-command center that offers you a personal view into what’s happening at work.\n\nWith this release, we’re introducing a dashboard as your default view of Pitch. Today, when you open up your workspace you’ll see the presentations you’ve most recently viewed or worked on. In the future, we hope to take this even further, showing you the templates you work with and the notifications that matter most.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/bigimage_ramsrefresh.jpg] [alt:Pitch presentation software dashboard design] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## A reimagined editor that prioritizes speed and collaboration\n\nWhen we ask users about the benefits of Pitch, many mention speed, efficiency, and consistency compared to the presentation software they used before. But based on user testing sessions — [and our own experience using Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/why-you-should-develop-features-people-dont-ask-for) — we knew there were opportunities for improvement.\n\nOur new editor is designed to help you focus like never before. Every element on your slide has an inline editor that shows you the most relevant options. Just point, click, and edit.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/inlineeditor_ramsrefresh.jpg] [alt:Pitch inline editor] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you’re editing text, you can quickly switch between text styles, change the font size, adjust alignment, and more.\n\nYou can also search from a library of nearly two million [inspiring, beautiful Unsplash images](https://unsplash.com/blog/unsplash-pitch/) to find the perfect visuals for every slide. Once you’ve added an image, you can use the inline editor to quickly replace it — Pitch will remember your most recent search.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/unsplash_video_hb_kpnpbv.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/PitchxUnsplash.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWith this update, we’ve completely removed our right-hand panel and replaced it with a bubble bar. This brings the key workflows that go into collaborating on presentations to the foreground while giving you more space to work on your slides. In the bubble bar, you’ll find:\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/collaboration-for-blog-hb_tfuqif.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/Collaboration-for-Blog-HB.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Design**: If you want to make more extensive edits to your slides, the design panel includes the advanced functionality not included in the inline editor.\n\n**Workflow**: Before, slide assignments and status updates were hidden in the Collaboration tab. With this change, you can immediately see what’s happening with a slide and quickly update its owner and status.\n\n**Comments**: Viewing open comments or adding your own is faster than ever.\n\n**Reactions**: Tools like Slack have helped standardize the idea of emoji reactions. Why leave a comment saying you agree when you can save time and space with 👍? Like comments, we’ve brought this into our mobile web app experience so that collaborating in Pitch across any device is seamless.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/reactions_ramsrefresh.jpg] [alt:Reactions Pitch presentation software] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Notes**: We’re thrilled to finally bring speaker notes to Pitch. Add important messages and ideas as speaker notes so that you or others can reference them while editing or presenting.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/implementartion.jpg] [alt:Speaker notes Pitch presentation software] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’ve also added a slide editor, which sits just below the slide canvas. Browse and add slides from [templates](https://pitch.com/templates), switch between presentation styles, and work with background colors and images faster than before.\n\n## How did we get here?\n\nToday’s release was a massive effort that involved every product team and department at Pitch. The journey to this release was one that forced us to challenge our initial assumptions and identify new ways of working cross-functionally. In our next post, we’ll take a deeper look at what it’s like to redesign and rethink an app that’s still being built.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["News"],"title":"Pitch raises $19M from Index, Slack \u0026 more","date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Christian Reber","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/funding_cover.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/pitch-investment-meta.jpg","teaser-text":"Today we are proud to announce a $19M Series A, led by Index Ventures and our existing investor BlueYard.","excerpt":"Hello world!

With Slack and Front transforming business communication, Airtable and Coda disrupting Excel, and Sketch and Framer on a mission to break Photoshop’s monopoly, we saw innovation and thoughtful design resetting expectations and reimagining the user experience of complex business software. Yet, even with this shift, presentation tools have not kept pace with technology; we believe there needs to be something new, different and substantially better.\n\nPresentations have defined entire industries, architected how organisations function, how work itself is shaped and how information and knowledge is conveyed throughout markets and societies. They impact the lives and businesses of hundreds of millions of users every day, with billions of hours spent on crafting and delivering presentations. Major personal and economic decisions are based on presentation software. Yet existing tools are overly complex, bundled with other software, do not integrate with external data sources and have limited collaboration features.\n\nPitch is a new beginning. We set out to rethink how individuals and teams express ideas, collaborate and communicate progress, and support their decision-making with well-understood data. The result is an ambitious vision to build an open platform and radically improve the way presentations are crafted and knowledge is shared. A new paradigm, designed for everyone, made for teams.\n\nWe’re still at an early stage of our product. We’re spending an enormous amount of time on testing, tweaking and polishing until every detail is perfect.

This new investment will enable us to pursue our vision for Pitch, and we’re unveiling the first pieces of that vision today. I’d like to take this opportunity to walk you through our journey so far, and what’s next.\n\nSince we founded Pitch in 2018, we’ve been incredibly focused on building the fastest and most delightful experience for teams to create, collaborate on and share beautiful, impactful presentations. Every week, we’ve released new features and updates to enhance our core product experience, and we will only accelerate from here. \n\nOur roadmap for 2021 is jam-packed with major improvements, like animations and transitions, grouping, zooming, mobile apps for Android and iOS, more refined exporting options, even faster and more responsive real-time collaboration, and so much more — all while delivering best-in-class performance and reliability. \n\nBut we didn’t raise $85 million just to build a next-generation presentation tool. We raised this new funding to pursue the vision my co-founders and I started Pitch with: to build the first complete platform for presentations, where anyone can discover, create, collaborate on, present, and publish their best thinking. \n\nThat means we’re going to introduce exciting new experiences that unify the fragmented workflow of presenting, and what comes afterward. In the coming weeks we’ll be rolling out several new pieces of that vision. Let me take you through a few initiatives you can expect to see very soon.\n\n## A full publishing and content ecosystem\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Q2announcement_Platform_Animated.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Q2announcment_CreatorProfile.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPresentations are best at communicating complex ideas and thoughts in simple and digestible terms. Yet too many of our best ideas get overlooked or lost, because presentations have never had a dedicated home. It’s time to change that.\n\nWe’re building a full ecosystem for publishing and exchanging [presentations](https://pitch.com/presentations) and [templates](https://pitch.com/templates). We aim to connect anyone who’s looking for inspiration with world-class content from top creators and brands to help them get started on their next presentation. Our vision is to turn Pitch into a thriving destination for the world's best thinkers and makers to share revolutionary ideas, and where everyone can express themselves with playful storytelling and share inspiring personal journeys.\n\nThe first pieces of this destination will arrive very soon: In the upcoming weeks, we’ll roll out the first profile pages for creators. We’ll be opening up access to everyone this summer, and we can’t wait to see our community bring this ecosystem to life.\n\n## Advanced presentation analytics\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Q2announcment_Analytics.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe typical process of sharing a presentation is as fragmented as it can possibly be. For most of us, it usually means creating a deck, converting it into a static PDF, and either emailing it as an attachment or uploading it to an external service to transfer it. And when we do, we have little or no visibility into whether the recipient opened it, what they thought of it, whether they’ve shared it with others, or whether they even received it at all. We’ve all been flying blind.\n\nWe believe teams deserve an integrated workflow for distribution and performance. That’s why we recently introduced presentation views, and we’ll soon be rolling out major updates to enable secure sharing and advanced analytics right within Pitch. Expect custom links and password protection, as well as detailed insights into what’s getting read, how much time it’s taking, and which slides are most engaging.\n\nFinally, teams sending presentations with Pitch will know exactly what’s resonating, and what needs more work. Presentation analytics will be launched in multiple stages throughout the coming months.\n\n## Record and play back anywhere\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Q2announcement_Narration_Animated.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/2_Q2announcment_Big_image_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’re in a new world of work. Meetings aren’t happening strictly in conference rooms anymore, and teams have traded in-person standups for asynchronous, remote alignment. At Pitch, we’re focused on making sure our tools stay ahead of the curve. \n\nSo we’re building new ways to highlight, record, and play back presentations in any context. We’ll enable presenters to deliver expressive narratives that can be consumed anytime, and on any platform, and we’ll give recipients the flexibility to get up to speed when they’re ready, not when everyone’s schedules happen to align.\n\nCurrently in beta testing, these new tools will be available very soon, and will ensure teams presenting with Pitch can keep audiences anywhere and everywhere engaged.\n\n## Where this is all headed\n\nWe’ve got no shortage of things to tackle this year. My most important job is to ensure we don’t lose sight of the bigger picture, and the reason we’re doing any of this. \n\nWe believe in the power of teams. We believe that if we can unlock the full potential of presentations, teams will be stronger and more connected, companies will scale faster, and incredible new products will be conceived and brought to market.\n\nIn short, our mission at Pitch is to enable every team’s best thinking. \n\n**So, to wrap things up, what’s next for Pitch:**\n\n* Core product enhancements and new apps for iOS, iPadOS \u0026 Android\n* Publishing functionality and content ecosystem\n* Advanced presentation analytics \u0026 better sharing capabilities\n* Recording and playback features for asynchronous presentation delivery\n\nThis is just a sneak peek of what we’re working on. We’re thinking big, and we’re building this for you. Thank you to all our employees, our customers, and our community. If you’re as excited as we are about what we’re building, please check out [our careers page](https://pitch.com/jobs).\n\nAnd if you haven't experienced Pitch yet, check it out and tell us what you think — it’s free.\n\nBest,\n\nChristian\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["News"],"title":"Pitch’s response to the war in Ukraine","visible-title":"Pitch’s response to the war in Ukraine","date":"2022-03-03T13:33:09.161Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Christian Reber","mobile-image":"","image":"","mid-image":"","wide-image":"","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1646318902/blog/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Ukraine.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1646319115/blog/Social_share_Ukraine.jpg","teaser-text":"As we have continued to witness the abhorrent actions of the Russian government and its military, we have decided to block Russian and Belarusian IP addresses from accessing our services.","excerpt":"We stand with Ukraine.","slug":"/blog/pitchs-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine","content":"We stand with Ukraine. \n\nThe Russian government’s unprovoked invasion and continued violence is destroying communities, and putting so many lives at risk.\n\nAs we have continued to witness the abhorrent actions of the Russian government and its military, **we have decided to block Russian and Belarusian IP addresses from accessing our services**.

We’re introducing a new integration that helps teams embed any Pitch presentation in Notion so that teams can stay in sync, no matter where they’re working. \n\nAre you a fan of Notion? We sure are. Our teams use it for day-to-day project management, roadmap planning, and [more](https://pitch.com/blog/3-ways-we-use-pitch-notion-to-work-better-as-a-remote-team). But when it comes to communicating our team’s most important thinking — board decks, sales proposals, and all-hands updates, to name a few examples — we rely on Pitch.\n\nWe want to help teams stay more aligned by bringing all types of information closer together. That’s why we’re releasing our first external integration, built using [Notion’s link preview API](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/notion-api-link-previews-feature). Link previews enable you to view always-up-to-date files from external tools like Dropbox, Figma, and now also Pitch, without leaving Notion.\n\nNow, you can enrich your Notion pages with embedded presentations, from sales decks [featuring recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) to company overviews to personal onboarding guides. Anyone in your Notion workspace can review important presentations, even if they don’t have a Pitch account. And you don’t have to make presentations public or invite teammates as guests to share vital company knowledge.\n\n### Get started with Pitch link previews\n\nWith link previews, you can display private data securely and across multiple pages, unlike with Notion embeds that require public access to individual files. Simply paste a link and let anyone with access to the Notion page browse your presentation, even if they’re not a member of your Pitch workspace. All links are continuously updated, so you can rest assured that your teammates always see the latest version of your slides. \n\nStart by pasting a Pitch link on any page and then authorizing the integration to turn the static link into a live preview. You only need to do this once. Next time, just paste a link.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1651843572/blog/Notion_integration_flying_objects_background.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651845785/blog/Notion_1.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### See link previews in action with two free templates\n\nWe’ve created two Notion templates to showcase internal workflows where link previews shine.\n\nAt Pitch, we welcome new colleagues with a personal onboarding page. Inside, we list several resources, like an onboarding deck from their new manager, our employee handbook, and an overview of their first project. Looking to set new teammates up for success faster? Start with [our onboarding template](https://www.notion.so/templates/pitchs-onboarding-checklist).\n\nOr perhaps your sales team tracks prospects and leads in Notion? If you send personalized sales decks to individual clients, then our [deal room template](https://www.notion.so/templates/pitchs-sales-deal-room) will help you keep everything in one place.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651849096/blog/Notion_2__w1200.png] [alt:Sales deal room Notion template] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://www.notion.so/templates/pitchs-sales-deal-room] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTogether with Notion, we strive to help teams securely and effortlessly sync up-to-date information. We built our new integration to empower your team with a single source of truth and reduce context switching between tools and time wasted searching to find the right files.

Knowing how to design presentations that are both effective and visually stunning is a skill set valuable not just for designers, but for everyone in the modern workplace. \n\nI'm one of Pitch's senior visual designers, and one of my main roles is to oversee the design of our [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates). When creating presentation templates, I constantly need to keep in mind the balance between looks and usability. Something can look really nice, but if it doesn't communicate the messages well, then it doesn't matter how beautiful it is. From readability to presenting information effectively, I'll share some of the basic principles of [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/9-creative-presentation-designs-dribbble-playoff) and my tips for [designing better presentations](https://pitch.com/blog/designing-presentation-templates). \n\n## 1. Readability\n\nHave you ever seen those slides that are filled with so much content and background noise you don’t even want to bother reading? A presentation that looks nice is great, but the viewer has to be able to easily read the slide and digest the content to make it useful. Here are a few tips for designing readable presentations. \n\n### White space is your friend.\n\nMake sure there is enough margin around your text to keep it from feeling cramped.\n\n### When writing, try to be clear and concise.\n\nHuge blocks of texts can be intimidating. If you're writing paragraphs, limit it to 12 words per line for optimum readability (reading a long line of text causes fatigue).\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/1_2_Big_image_DesTip_1_2__w1200_slxif0.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/1_2_Big_image_DesTip_1_2__w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Pay attention to height.\n\nTypefaces with higher x-heights are much easier to read, especially at smaller sizes. \n\n### Proper line-height is also important.\n\nToo tight makes it hard to read/claustrophobic. Too loose makes it feel like the paragraph is no longer a cohesive unit.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/3_Small_image_DesTip_3_uecgtx.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/3_Small_image_w800_-_DesTips_2.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen dealing with readability, think about how people will see it. Presentations aren’t just for giving talks on stage or in meeting rooms. Today, they’re often used for information sharing, [internal updates](https://pitch.com/use-cases/team-meetings), and company documentation. If you’re not there to present in person, good layout and structure are your best form of nonverbal, effective communication.\n\nMaking presentations for internal use is often easier because these presentations are essentially used as documents. When you’re working on a screen to be viewed on screens, what you see is pretty much what you get. But, if you’re making a [presentation for a conference](https://pitch.com/templates/Conference-Presentation-Bold-69F8is0Mobky57mj4v3grQJB), you also have to consider what it will look like on a big screen.\n\nIs your copy readable from afar and from different angles? Is there enough contrast for your audience to see important details without squinting? Whether it's for the big screen, mobile, or meant to be printed out – these mediums will all have different considerations that will impact your design decisions.\n\n## 2. Presenting information effectively\n\nPresentations don't have to be filled with complicated charts and difficult-to-digest diagrams. Designed correctly, visuals make complex data or information easy to understand. Today, there are many options for presenting information beyond charts and graphs: You can embed videos, use GIFS, or link out to other resources to expand on your point. \n\n### **Use the rule of 3's when organizing information on a slide.**\n\nYou can easily turn a cramped slide of text into a well-organized visual simply by breaking apart the information into three main points.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/5_Small_image_DesTip_5_lizxse.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/5_Small_image_w800_-_DesTips_5.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### **Use emphasis and hierarchy for the most important points.**\n\nVisually highlight points you definitely don’t want your viewers to miss – by enlarging the font size, making it a different color, or bolding it.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/4_Big_image_DesTip_4__w1200_ALT1mp4_g4s10w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/4_Big_image_DesTips_4__w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### **Don’t add extra visuals just because.**\n\nVisuals should support, not distract from, your point. Too many causes a slide to look cluttered.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/7_Big_image_DesTip_7__w1200_oiyr91.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/7_Big_image_DesTips_7__w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 3. Creating visual consistency in your presentation\n\nSlides don't exist in a silo. When designing presentations slide by slide, you often end up with a bunch of slides that work individually, but lack cohesion as a unit. This can lead to painful revisions to content, layout, structure, and of course, design. It's important to build visual consistency into your presentation from the get go, and to keep it in mind as you design. \n\nBackgrounds and slide frames can help you create consistency across your [slide deck](https://pitch.com/use-cases/slideshow-maker). Whether solid or gradient, filled with shapes or photos or even patterns, keeping your backgrounds the same (or similar) across slides helps them feel more cohesive as people navigate through. Another way to achieve this is by framing your slides with a topbar or sidebar.\n\nIn Pitch, you can easily keep your slides consistent with styles. Simply [create a presentation](https://pitch.com/blog/switch-to-pitch), or choose a template from our [template gallery](https://pitch.com/templates), add your brand elements — like colors and custom fonts — directly to Pitch, and create an on-brand design in minutes. Not only is this good for getting started, but it’s also great for collaborating with a team. Designers can easily update messaging, colors, and typography, and distribute them to others right away.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Template_StyleLoopBGCompressed_qzmhjd.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Template_StyleLoopBG_fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 4. Consider the context\n\nLast but not least...the best presentation design always depends on the context. Your audience and objective impact everything from font choice to colors. For example, if you're designing an [Annual Report](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Reports) for a long-established corporate bank, you might not want to use hot pink, but something more professional and serious, like a deep blue. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nKeeping context in mind is important, not only in the beginning stages of coming up with a concept but throughout the process of designing a presentation.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThat being said, here's a quick recap of our presentation design tips, and the top takeaways to remember when you're designing your next deck: \n\n* Good layout and structure will be your best form of nonverbal, effective communication—keep your slides breathable, digestible, and scannable.\n* Test your presentation in the actual medium it will be viewed from. This will vary from printed out documents to overhead/enlarged screens.\n* Remember: A nice design is only part of it! Content and presentation are equally as important.\n* Ask yourself: Is your content easy to scan? Will your audience be able to understand it without having to read over the content over and over again? Will a graph or diagram help?\n\nYou can see [these principles in practice from nine designer presentations that won a Dribbble Playoff Competition](https://pitch.com/blog/9-creative-presentation-designs-dribbble-playoff) sponsored by Pitch.

Every day, modern teams are finding new, innovative ways to use presentations to help them work faster and more collaboratively.\n\nAs you can likely guess, we spend quite a lot of time using Pitch internally. From internal knowledge sharing to group brainstorming, we use presentations for just about everything we do in our day-to-day work. And along the way, we've stumbled upon some exciting new use cases for [presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates). In this post, we'll share some of our favorites ones that are especially relevant for modern teams who need to connect and collaborate remotely.\n\n## 1. Team retrospective\n\nAfter finishing any project, retrospectives are a crucial step to reflect and make improvements for next time around. Retrospectives can be tough, even when you're in the same room. When you're conducting a retrospective over Zoom, it's even more important to have everyone on the same page and to make the objective of the discussion clear. At Pitch, we found an effective way to do team retrospectives is to give each person their own slide for thinking and jotting down notes. Then, we come together to share our \"sticky notes\" on the proverbial whiteboard and document action items for follow up. In this way, the retrospective becomes a sort of living and interactive document, while still enabling effective communication and clear takeaways. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/c8b104ff-e22e-4ad6-88aa-e41dd4a6b25e?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 2. Virtual offsite\n\n[Our design team created such a cool presentation](https://pitch.com/blog/running-remote-offsites-and-onboardings) for their virtual offsite, we wanted to make it a template for everyone to use. This template is a remote-friendly way to bond with teammates and get to know one another better. Since it was introduced, teams across the company, like engineering and marketing, have used it as a starting point for their own offsite. It offers just the right level of structure and flexibility to get your creativity going, and the perfect balance of fun and functionality to make any bonding session a great one. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/262dfea1-4780-47c6-842d-106435be697c?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 3. Team bulletin\n\nAt Pitch, we're big fans of bulletins. So much so that we wrote [an entire post detailing how we use them internally](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins). We love that we can use them to keep everyone updated on what's going on around the company and to communicate important updates in a remote-friendly way. For us, they're like an async all-hands meeting. With this template, you can easily start creating bulletins to share information across your team or company. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/ac0e268f-890a-45eb-a3ef-045ba8ea26f7?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 4. Job listing\n\nHiring is tough, but one thing that makes it better is when you have a highly shareable job posting that your network is excited to help circulate to potential hires. Presentations are a format that’s more engaging and personalized than a classic landing page. They’re also much more robust than a traditional job posting and give you room to be creative with content. With this template, you can easily add media like photos and videos of your latest company outing, or give it some personality with GIFs. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/7282b5d2-b4ce-45e4-9496-11f2dc069637?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 5. Release notes\n\nEach week, we create a presentation version of our release notes, so we can clearly and concisely share the latest changes in our product (you can check out our most recent [release notes](https://pitch.com/whats-new) here). They’re not only a great way to keep users informed, but also to retain frustrated users who might otherwise be in the dark about bug fixes or new features that they’ve been waiting for. Product release notes help us let users know that their feedback was not only heard, but that it was used to make meaningful changes. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/699a37c0-ace6-40d0-84d7-91027230568c?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"3 months, 50+ updates: Q2 in review","date":"2020-07-06T09:26:06.958Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header-mobile-w800-.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header-small-w1200-.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header-mid-w1440-.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header-big-w1920-.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover-thumbnail-420x300.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/social-share.jpg","teaser-text":"Over the past three months, we’ve shipped dozens of new features and improvements.

During this time, it’s become clearer than ever that teams need new tools to support the different ways they work — in real time or asynchronously, but always together.\n\nSince April, we’ve introduced several major updates to help teams work more effectively, no matter where they are. In total, we shipped 21 new features, 38 improvements, and 80 bug fixes. We’ve also continued to expand our beta, adding thousands of new users and working to optimize the new-user experience.\n\nHere’s a round-up of what we’ve been working on. \n\n## Create beautifully on-brand decks for any topic\n\nOne of the hardest parts of creating presentations is getting started. Most of us — myself included — aren’t formally trained in [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips). Nailing your story and laying out content can be a daunting task. \n\nIn May, we launched our **template gallery** to provide you with all the inspiration you need to deliver an applause-worthy deck. Today, our template gallery has dozens of [professionally designed templates](https://pitch.com/blog/designing-presentation-templates)  — and we're adding more every month.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/template_gallery_3_givr2z.mp4] [poster:/uploads/TemplateGallery_q2.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYou can combine any of our templates with presentation styles to make them your own. We’ve made it even easier to keep content on-brand with **custom font support**. Upload your custom font or favorite Google font and start working with it immediately. And there are no limits, so if your brand uses multiple font families or font weights, you can add them all to Pitch.\n\n## Spend less time editing presentations\n\nThis quarter, we introduced even more ways to streamline your team's workflow.\n\nNow you can **manage and rearrange multiple slides** in your deck. More importantly, you can apply bulk actions. Paste an element, apply a presentation style, or change the status of multiple slides at once.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/multislide-photoshop.jpg] [alt:pitch multiselect presentation slides] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Work together — no matter where you are\n\nThough our beta is still small, teams are already working with each other across workspaces. Agencies are building templates for their clients, investors are helping fledgling startups on their pitch decks, and companies are delivering new business proposals to prospects.\n\nNow, in addition to team workspaces, we have **guest workspaces**. If you need to collaborate with people outside your company, you’ll now have a central place to organize that information instead of digging through your inbox or a file storage system.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/guest-workspace.jpg] [alt:pitch guest workspaces] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPitch has always supported real-time collaboration and co-editing. But with more and more people working remotely, we wanted to make it easier to get everyone on the same page. Click on a teammate’s avatar in Pitch, and you can jump to the slide they’re working on.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/slide_q2_ifdisl.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/slide_q2.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Share your ideas anywhere\n\nOur early users have continued to ask for new ways to share their Pitch presentations with the world. Some want to bring presentations into knowledge management systems like Notion, while others want to easily share conference presentations on their blogs.\n\nLast week we shipped **presentation embeds** to make it easier for others to interact with your public presentations. Right now they work with websites and tools like Notion and Coda. In the future, we want to make them available everywhere.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/small-image-w800-presentation-mode.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe next few months are sure to be exciting! On the product side, we’ll continue to focus on the core Pitch experience while working to introduce our first data integrations and mobile apps.\n\nWe’re also working hard to get more people off the waitlist and into Pitch.\n\nDuring the early phases of our beta, it was important to give each team a personal introduction, thoroughly document their feedback, and incorporate it into our roadmap. Now, we’re ready to dramatically scale up the number of invites going out each week, starting with teams who have signed up using their work email.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/big-image-w1200-.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe’re kicking off the next round of invites mid-July, so be on the lookout for an email from us. If you haven’t joined our waitlist yet, there’s still time to sign up for early access. (We’re focusing on teams at the moment, so make sure you use your work email.)\n\nWe’re so grateful for how patient you’ve been while we work to make Pitch the best way to collaborate on presentations. We promise you won't be waiting much longer.\n"},{"type":"category","title":"Product Updates","excerpt":"","slug":"/blog/product-updates","content":""},{"type":"blog","category":["Product Updates"],"title":"Open beta: Publish your presentations","date":"2022-07-05T08:33:41.696Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Masha Maksimava","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948152/blog/Publishing/Header_MOBILE_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948153/blog/Publishing/Header_SMALL_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948152/blog/Publishing/Header_MID_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948152/blog/Publishing/Header_BIG_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948151/blog/Publishing/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948153/blog/Publishing/Social_share_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement.png","teaser-text":"You can now publish your best presentations on Pitch. Sign up to our open beta to start building an audience around your decks.","excerpt":"Starting today, you can join top founders, brands, and creatives in publishing presentations to Pitch.

Lead the discussion around topics you care about and get your work in front of your audience, whether you’re building your brand or hoping to generate leads. \n\n*Update: Note that we’re no longer accepting applicants to the publishing beta. Keep an eye on [What’s New](https://pitch.com/whats-new) for further news on presentation publishing.*\n\nSince we launched our [presentation gallery](https://pitch.com/presentations) last fall, creators have published beautiful, insightful decks on an array of topics important to fast-growing software companies and agencies. Through the gallery, creators have been able to showcase their work — and expand their outreach.\n\nNow we’re moving presentation publishing into open beta, so anyone with a Pitch account can easily publish their best ideas. With this development, creators have more tools to publicly share their standout work and grow an online presence around it.\n\n## Build a profile for your decks\n\nOnce you join the beta, you’ll be prompted to create a public profile with a unique handle (ours is [@pitch](https://pitch.com/u/pitch)). Then, any presentation you publish will be automatically added to your profile. With all your decks in one place, this new channel unlocks more sharing options versus sending decks individually via public links. \n\nFor example, if you’re an agency, your public profile becomes a great place to demonstrate a portfolio of work. You can build your brand by posting decks that your target market wants to see. Or you can use [recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) to publish a series of decks, like classes in a course or chapters of a story. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948149/blog/Publishing/1_Inline_image_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1200.jpg] [alt:Public profile] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPublishing has other benefits too. For instance, when adding a deck, you can include descriptions for more context. Published presentations also have view counts that help your popular content stand out. Most importantly, your audience can now navigate between your published decks to discover (and consume) more of your work.\n\nTo convert this audience, you can add buttons on your profile that link to your social accounts, email, and website. Monika Ocieczek, Head of Product Design at Primer, was able to create [an engaging presentation](https://pitch.com/presentations/Primers-Product-Design-Playbook-3dtZFa3it6iW5XV7KL5YCvP4) that prompted action. “Publishing a deck with recordings made it feel very personal,” she said. “Since it was published, I’ve hired multiple designers who all felt Primer was right for them after seeing the deck. It was really the perfect way to communicate our team’s design culture!”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Since it was published, I’ve hired multiple designers who all felt Primer was right for them after seeing the deck.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Get featured in our gallery\n\nThe presentation gallery is a dedicated frontpage for the best decks made in Pitch. Our team reviews all of the published presentations and features the most beautiful and insightful ones, as well as those that add value to our community. That might mean highlighting examples of effective sales decks, or content on relevant topics like product-led growth or building happy teams. \n\nYou can increase your brand's visibility by providing useful content in the gallery. Sara Archer, VP Sales at ChartMogul, said of [publishing to Pitch](https://pitch.com/presentations/Forecasting-in-a-product-led-business-6S4WsQ5XmjPm4LVRaq3AWJxn), “We’re always looking for new ways, alongside our product, to help teams measure and grow their revenue. Pitch’s presentation gallery gave us the space to publish guidance for teams forecasting in a product-led business. We’ve already had thousands of views on our first deck published in the beta.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“We’ve already had thousands of views on our first deck published in the beta.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother way to capture this interest is to include links and call-to-actions in your decks. You have a wider audience at your fingertips, so why not turn those published presentations into interactive landing pages?\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck, [browse the gallery](https://pitch.com/presentations) for inspiration. The most successful decks often mix beautiful design with informative or thought-provoking content. \n\n## Stand out in a collection\n\nCollections are groups of decks in the presentation gallery that share similar themes, formats, or goals. We launched collections so that users looking for targeted inspiration can browse a range of content on a specific topic.\n\nAppearing in a collection helps connect your work with an audience looking for more on that subject. If you share your expertise on running a product organization, for example, your deck could land in the popular [Product Principles](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/product-principles-6nxcac0pUhsz5Apy457FWGra) collection — and serve as a resource for product managers, designers, and engineers seeking guidance on how to build great products.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1656948152/blog/Publishing/2_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_1200w.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656948149/blog/Publishing/2_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_1200w.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nCollections also help shine a light on businesses and ideas that deserve to be seen. We were shocked that [only 2% of venture capital](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/women-founders-raised-just-2-of-venture-capital-money-last-year) goes toward women founders. So we created a [Female-Founded Startups](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) collection featuring pitch decks from over 100 incredible companies succeeding despite this bias. \n\nThink about how your presentation could add value within an existing collection. Clearly positioning your content will make it easier for our team to understand its potential fit. Alternatively, recommend a new collection in [our community](https://pitch.com/community), and band together with others to publish presentations on a common theme!\n\n## Join the beta and share your ideas\n\nOnce you’ve joined the beta, you’ll see a new option in the **Share** menu labeled **Publish to Pitch.com**. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize your public profile, and start [sharing your decks](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4944638-publish-your-presentation-on-pitch-beta) with the world.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1657022443/blog/Publishing/3_Inline_image_Open_beta_Publishing_beta_announcement_w1200.jpg] [alt:Publishing a presentation] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## The future of publishing\n\nThere’s a lot more in store for publishing. We’re going to make it even easier for visitors to discover and interact with published presentations. And we have plans to make the process collaborative, so that multiple colleagues can design, approve, and publish decks together. \n\nIf you have any feedback or you’d like to highlight a deck you’ve published, let us know, share it on social media, or [join our community](https://pitch.com/community).

Virality is no longer enough — instead, startups need to focus on how to capture demand.**\n\nThis brave new market environment will prove especially tricky for startup teams pursuing product-led growth (PLG) business models. This go-to-market motion is built for viral user growth, but turning that popularity into revenue means dialing into precisely the right mix of acquisition channels, features, pricing, messaging, and more. Even teams with the best-laid PLG plans can’t fuel their own growth forever — they’ll eventually need to generate a pipeline and capture additional demand with [sales teams](https://pitch.com/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams) to avoid plateauing revenue growth.\n\nThat’s not to say the product-led growth playbook is at risk. In fact, it’s never been more relevant, because it’s designed to meet the way today's businesses (and consumers) expect to make purchases: Try before you buy. In fact, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/power-challenger-sales-model#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20found%20that%20customers,they%27re%20willing%20to%20pay) found that software buyers are typically over 50% through the process before their first contact with sales occurs.\n\nNow that virality is no longer enough, it’s time for startups to make a solid plan for how to turn demand into revenue. While it’s true that every business is different, there are a few commonalities in every go-to-market journey I’ve been a part of over the past two decades. Here's my map for the journey from popular to profitable.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/34cbde12-70f6-4e35-b4c2-b291e25e2ae2\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 5 steps to go from popular to profitable\n\n### 1. Search for your SAM\n\nIt’s vital to understand which market segments your current product can address, and to know that your go-to-market team can tackle their needs at your current size and scale.\n\nMeasuring your serviceable addressable market (SAM) is where the go-to-market journey really starts. The SAM is the little sibling of the total addressable market (TAM), a figure often given in fundraising — and it's the piece of the pie you can win right now.\n\nTo identify your SAM, there are a few questions you should be asking:\n\n* Which early users are regularly engaging with your product? \n* What do those engaged users have in common? \n* How are they actually using your product? \n* What problems are you solving for them, and what value are they getting? \n* Would they pay for your product? And if so, how would they buy it?\n\nInvesting the time to establish these criteria will help you define your ideal customer profile. The search for your SAM is a continuous process, especially as the capabilities of your team and product expand. But having a clear understanding of your initial SAM is milestone #1 in your go-to-market journey.\n\n### 2. Define your product-qualified leads\n\nYour search for your SAM should have given you a sense of the types of signups you’re trying to drive — and with any luck, you’ve won over some active users. \n\nWith a few acquisition channels up and running, the next milestone in your go-to-market journey is defining a product-qualified lead (PQL).\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to combine three types of data: \n\n* **Web analytics**: Understand your active users’ pre-signup touchpoints, and map a typical top-of-funnel journey through web analytics tools like Google Analytics and Mixpanel.\n* **Product telemetry data**: Map the behavior patterns of active users, as well as the features or capabilities they're using, with product telemetry data from tools like Amplitude.\n* **Firmographic insights**: Build accurate profiles of users — including company size, sector, geography, role, and department — through third-party firmographic data from vendors like Crunchbase or Clearbit. \n\nTaken together, these data sources can be used to define what I consider the gold standard of a PQL. These leads have the highest adoption and expansion potential, and the best chance of converting to revenue-driving customers. \n\nAt this stage of your go-to-market journey, learning to identify and reach PQLs should be your top priority. Because PQLs have already signed up, they represent a live “proof of concept” and provide an effective conduit for targeting their teammates. With relevant messaging and compelling incentives, the chances of converting these leads to a committed, contracted deal are very high.\n\nOptimize your messaging for relevance and build automated, signal-based sequences that deliver the right messaging, and you’ll have the ideal system in place to make it to the next stage of growth.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Go-to-Market-Strategy-2GV8PT7VZx5Q5Zpxtd0kSdXU\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655996421/fundraising-guide/Go-To-Market_Strategy_TwoUp.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/series-a-pitch-deck.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Series-A-Pitch-Deck-6zvhbC3F8Bac4MtHYQ0RSaee\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Strategy] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### **3. Dial in the right demand-generation mix**\n\nWhen executed correctly, PLG as an initial growth motion gives you a lot of advantages. Since the product drives self-serve engagement, it immediately makes the experience “sticky” and reduces the time-to-value for users. Layer on effective viral growth loops, and the product drives account expansion too. \n\nBut even the best PLG motions eventually hit a demand plateau. Your pipeline will need to be kickstarted to keep producing PQLs. Experiencing this firsthand while at Stripe and CircleCI, my advice is this: Don’t fear the demand plateau — plan for it. \n\nWhen you can no longer rely on brand word-of-mouth and SEO alone, your mission is to find the right blend of demand-generation tactics. Paid marketing, gated content, and events all have distinct advantages and disadvantages, which vary by market. The key is a structured approach to experimentation that helps you land on the right mix for generating leads.\n\nWhen you’ve found the sweet spot, you’ll be able to overcome your demand plateau and take your business to the next stage of growth.\n\n### 4. Win market share step-by-step\n\nNow that you’ve opened up new demand for your product with new demand-generation tactics, it’s time to capture it. The most frequent mistake I see go-to-market leaders make here is to treat all leads in the same way, applying the same sales methods and expecting the same conversion rates.\n\nAt this point, you’re in the middle of [crossing the chasm](https://medium.com/mbreads/crossing-the-chasm-6fe8426eb270). Back when your product launched, your early adopters likely didn’t all share a market segment, but they did all share a desire to try out cutting-edge tools. Now, demand-gen is opening up your sales funnel to a broader range of potential customers. \n\nAs you reach the mass market, you'll be acquiring leads that want more proof of your credentials and credibility in their specific sector. Before these leads seriously consider buying your product themselves, they'll want to see which of their industry peers already use it — and hear how you're meeting their pain points.\n\nOn this side of the chasm, winning market share requires a more systematic approach. Divide your market opportunity into segments (typically either regions or industry verticals, or both), prioritize them on size and winnability, and align your sales, marketing, and support teams toward winning them sequentially — not all at once.\n\nIn markets where your product and promise alone aren't enough, your customers' brand names are the key to making headway.\n\n### 5. Get local to keep growing globally\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve built a world-class go-to-market engine and team for generating and capturing demand. But that still won’t be enough on its own to win your total addressable market. Get ready to invest in regional sales and marketing expertise to find further pockets of growth potential through localization and team presence in the same time zone.\n\nCultural differences can’t be learned remotely; they need to be lived. To sell effectively, you need to understand who you’re selling to and where to reach these prospects. That requires local knowledge and expertise. If you’re serious about global expansion, this is a critical step.\n\nDuring my time leading EMEA for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), I built a team that deeply understood our region’s intricate fabric of local business cultures — and the importance of tailoring regional go-to-market efforts instead of just copying our US model. Together, we were able to adapt what had worked in the US and evolve it to meet the distinct needs of our EMEA-based customers, growing the region to account for 25% of company revenue. Getting this step right can propel you to a global scale.\n\n## A powerful, predictable productivity model\n\nThe final stop on your growth journey isn’t just measured in revenue dollars, headcount, or market share. You’ll know you’re there when you’ve built a predictable model for closing deals and scaling team productivity. \n\nAt this point, you can efficiently acquire new customers through your marketing channels and consistently generate leads and deal pipeline through PQLs. You have a clear template for closing deals — and the more deals you do, the easier it gets. You’ve learned to maneuver the obstacles in your path to signing customers. And you understand how productivity drivers, like through-funnel acquisition rates and self-serve expansion rates, influence your customer acquisition and revenue models. This means you can invest your resources with confidence, knowing that each new sales team head will contribute to your revenue growth.\n\nThese are the foundational signs of a business that’s built for the long run. Once you reach profitability (or have a clearly defined path for doing so), you’ll be able to create consistent and predictable growth by delivering effective returns on your investment.\n\nIf you’d like to talk about your team’s progress on your growth journey, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasmills/?originalSubdomain=uk).\n\n*A version of this article originally [appeared in TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/how-to-go-from-popular-to-profitable-during-a-downturn/).*"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch","Templates","Presentation Resources"],"title":"Running remote offsites and onboardings","date":"2020-08-27T10:16:32.388Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Tee Tran","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headermobile_remoteoffsite.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headersmall_remoteoffside.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headermid_remoteoffsite.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headerbig_remoteoffsite.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover_thumbnail_remoteoffsite.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/social_remoteoffsite.jpg","teaser-text":"How we run async virtual offsites and onboard new employees with Pitch\n","excerpt":"How do we continue bonding as a team now that we don’t see each other as regularly?

One of the biggest things we’ve realized is that it’s not just about applying the way we used to work in the office to online settings, but about finding truly remote and async-first ways of working and collaborating. In this post, we share a few ways we’ve found to come together virtually in team bonding and new employee onboarding.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/small-image-w800-remote-workers.png] [alt:bonding remotely in the pandemic] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## **Running a virtual offsite with Pitch**\n\nOne of the moments when this became apparent for us was while thinking about how we could run an effective (and fun!) offsite. We remembered how some companies that we admired were coming up with cool and creative ways to conduct virtual offsites, [like what Brex did with Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/844988539041540521).\n\nWe’re always looking to push the boundaries of how we can use our product and find new and creative use cases outside of those that decks are typically used for; so, with this inspiration in mind, the very first Pitch Virtual Offsite deck was born.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/virtualoffsiteslider_miorpm.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/virtualoffsitefallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe deck was designed to help us get to know each other better outside of work. Although there are some design-related questions, most are about the little-known fun facts, from niche hobbies to impressive talents. We found out one of our teammates opened for the Vengaboys as a teenager, and another lived in Zimbabwe for three years. \n\nWe took advantage of Pitch’s collaboration features to communicate and and work on the same deck, and in the process, we learned a lot of things about each other that wouldn't typically have come up during our normal workflow. It turned out to be such a success that other teams — like engineering and marketing — have adopted it for their own virtual offsites.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/262dfea1-4780-47c6-842d-106435be697c?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSome more ideas for how to bond async:\n\n* Everyone records a video to give a tour of their own house or working space, like MTV Cribs.\n* Beyond beer pong: [A fun list of online party games](https://www.timeout.com/usa/things-to-do/online-party-games-to-play-with-friends-remotely) where you can join in remotely.\n* Gift exchange: Set a price limit and assign everyone a different team member for a mystery gift exchange. Send to remote workers via international post.\n* [QuizBreaker:](https://www.quizbreaker.com/#how-it-works) Team members privately answer a set of questions. Afterwards, a quiz goes out where everyone tries to guess who asked what. \n\n## **Putting a face to the name: New employee onboarding with Loom**\n\nWe’ve had 18 new employees start since the beginning of the year (and we’re still growing — [check out our open positions](https://pitch.com/jobs)). First days at a new job can be intimidating — even more so if you’re joining a company without actually having met anyone face-to-face. It’s amazing that technology enables us to do so much online, but first impressions over chat only go so far.\n\nThat’s why we have all of our new employees make a short video introducing themselves. We include them in our weekly bulletin so that everyone has a chance to “meet and greet” their new teammates. It really helps putting a face — and a smile! — to a name.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/introvideos_etcmer.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/introvideosfallback.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother challenge for new employees is knowing how to get acquainted with all the information. Especially in remote organizations, which are often designed to have everything available, the hardest part can be knowing where to start. To make it easier for new employees, we began creating onboarding decks to help them get acquainted with everything at their own pace. They help us organize information and share links to the most relevant resources across the different tools we use, from Notion and Pitch to Figma and Slack.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9621f898-360c-454d-99f7-ed1c40e22117?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## **New employee FAQs**\n\nOur “Welcome” page in Notion is another helpful way we create a central location for the most important information for new employees. This page originally started as a way to house important docs, like how to set up your hardware and software, or an overview of who’s who in the company. Over time, it’s grown to include everything from a (very detailed) guide to using the espresso machine, to how we do meetings, introduce new software, and take sick and vacation days.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/small-image-w800-empoyee-faq.png] [alt:using notion for employee onboarding] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe always want employees to feel comfortable to ask questions, but sometimes it’s easiest to answer the most frequently asked questions up front. This helps us stay transparent as an organization while giving everyone the information they need to work effectively at Pitch.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n2020 has forced teams of all sorts and sizes to adapt to new ways of working. In addition to the adjustments we've needed to make as individuals to work from home effectively, together we've needed to find new ways of building a remote company culture and bonding as a team. Being apart hasn't stopped us from working and bonding together. In fact, it’s encouraged us to find new ways to stay close, all the while testing our own product and pushing its boundaries as a tool just for internal knowledge management and collaboration.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"8 sales deck examples that show how to win over prospects","visible-title":"8 sales deck examples that show how to win over prospects","date":"2022-11-02T06:24:37.305Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Sarah Kiefer","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206520/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Header_MOBILE.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206523/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Header_SMALL.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206521/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Header_MID_8.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206521/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Header_BIG.png","image-description":"A collection of sales deck examples from companies like Producter and Oliva on top of a purple background","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206518/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Cover_thumbnail_420x300.png","thumbnail-description":"A collection of sales deck examples from companies like Producter and Oliva on top of a purple background","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1667206522/blog/8-sales-deck-examples/Sales-deck-examples-Social_share.png","meta-image-description":"A collection of sales deck examples from companies like Producter and Oliva on top of a purple background","teaser-text":"Need to craft a sales deck that wins over new customers?

We’ve even published a step-by-step guide to sales presentations that goes into detail about [how to source ideas for your decks](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-ideas), [structure your deck](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-structure), and best practices for [delivering a presentation](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/how-to-present). \n\nSometimes though, it’s most useful to look at how companies similar to yours have created decks proven to work. In this article, we’ve brought together eight inspiring sales deck examples — and shared some tips and sales presentation templates along the way — to help you craft your own [winning sales materials](https://pitch.com/blog/sales-presentation-tips). \n\n## 1. Sastrify \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/72212eb7-cf32-4ac0-a494-788f24e0729f\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Sastrify](https://www.sastrify.com/) provides software tools and services for high-growth companies, helping them buy all types of software as a service (SaaS) products more effectively. Often, multiple parties have a say in a buying decision. So Sastrify’s sales deck breaks down the benefits for the three teams involved in their typical purchasing process: Finance, Procurement, and IT. They also anticipate questions and blockers with a list of [FAQs on slide 10](https://pitch.com/presentations/Sastrify-Sales-Deck-3gNwn943BWFn4bwwpu6i4yfs?slide=3fc40171-393f-4a40-8ef1-16ae7be2b2ee). This means any concerns about implementation hurdles can be addressed immediately, which shortens the sales cycle.\n\nFor a similar, team-by-team approach to guiding your prospect through the implementation process, try using our [mutual action plan](https://pitch.com/templates/Mutual-Action-Plan--4KwLVx4ad4XD5WWCcf7RVgtU) template.\n\n## 2. Spendesk \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/fb8d4e2b-1610-402a-8864-bd10f0e498e0\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Spendesk](https://www.spendesk.com/) is a spend management platform that helps users save time and money by giving them visibility into their company spending. Before prospective buyers go through the hassle of switching to a high-cost, long-term solution, they want to be sure they're investing in a best-in-breed product that offers stability, innovation, and quality. That’s why Spendesk starts their deck with an overview of their rapid growth trajectory, followed by a list of the well-known brands already using the platform.\n\nDemonstrate your own traction — and highlight well-known and respected customers — with a logo slide and testimonial quotes like those featured in our [bold sales deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Deck-Bold-4vTA5b5XHWXD4kRD7X4UJL8F) template\n\n## 3. ChartMogul \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/52864227-9e8f-4871-b626-d22028c12d82\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[ChartMogul](https://chartmogul.com/) is an analytics platform that helps their users run subscription businesses. Their sales deck demonstrates best practice for a pre-read or leave-behind deck. The classic Problem-Solution-Benefits structure is easy to follow, even without a voiceover. This is the kind of deck you could easily send on to a colleague to win them over when you’re already convinced about a new tool but need their go-ahead to commit.\n\nWhat makes an async pitch even more convincing? A recording of you presenting it, tailored to your prospect. Our [async sales deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge) template makes it easy to add recordings, so you can reach everyone — not just those in the room or on Zoom.\n\n## 4. Pocus \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/c2ea75b8-1ff2-4260-8cd8-23e934a18368\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Pocus](https://www.pocus.com/) is the first product-led sales platform. Their sales deck explains that there’s a global shift happening in the way we buy and sell. Opening your deck with a big change immediately creates urgency for the prospect: What am I going to do to respond to this big change? This format helped earn Zuora’s deck the title of [“greatest sales deck I’ve ever seen”](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-greatest-sales-deck-ive-ever-seen-4f4ef3391ba0) from the legendary Andy Raskin. Starting in this way also clearly positions your offering as part of the solution to any challenges thrown up by the change. \n\nUse our [sales proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Proposal-7TzhtL6zL3VC4R4itc4cUVNB) template to grab attention and open your sales deck with a big change.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Simple-Sales-Deck-7TPRBe4bud9z576qVR3RQpVE\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/simple-sales-deck.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Proposal-7TzhtL6zL3VC4R4itc4cUVNB\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665396135/templates-grid/sales-proposal.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Try for free] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 5.

Their sales deck shows how important visuals and design are to a successful sales presentation — it’s not just what you say in your deck, but how you say it. The [GIF on slide 4](https://pitch.com/presentations/Oliva-Huddles---group-workshops-with-impact-4j2GyG5kCY4t5TE7v60Uwbt2?slide=90a51908-b9d4-4bb3-8bb0-6bad94d2b013) adds visual interest, and the consistent, calming design elements reflect the mission of the company and the solution it’s offering.\n\nFor a similarly calming color palette, try our [simple sales deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Simple-Sales-Deck-7TPRBe4bud9z576qVR3RQpVE) template.

Their sales pitch deck opens with a quantification of the scale of the problem they’re trying to address; it then showcases testimonials from existing customers. This combination establishes what’s at stake — and Producter’s leading position as the company that has the solution.\n\nOur [project proposal template](https://pitch.com/templates/Project-Proposal-22pMbf55jF1o4wddqP6oSJYE) includes plenty of slides for stats and testimonials if you’re using a similar structure.\n\n## 7. Klima \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/596e842d-6014-457b-b2c7-ab18ca0a4ef5\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOften, your product speaks for itself. [Klima](https://klima.com/) is an app that fights climate change, and their B2B offering, “[Klima for teams](https://klima.com/teams/),” helps companies reduce, offset, and learn about their carbon emissions. Their deck focuses on showing the app in action. It makes it easy for potential users to picture themselves regularly using the product — and reassures them that it would be easy to adopt Klima as a tool.\n\nIf your sales pitch is focused on highlighting product features, check out our [product demo template](https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Demo-6gXTPr2hMAM34ojxLE5vPKDg).\n\n## 8. Patch \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/9328662d-ed02-4284-a80f-c4aba317eb92\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n[Patch](https://www.patch.io/) is building the infrastructure for a sustainable economy, and their sales deck doesn’t waste a single pixel. Challenge yourself to boil down your message to its simplest form. Then inspire your prospects with possibilities as you brainstorm the opportunities for collaboration together.\n\nOur [ad agency pitch](https://pitch.com/templates/Ad-Agency-Pitch-4GR5Vz0HqWxp4HcfDN0N5XFa) template can easily be adapted to create a similarly pared-back, design-forward, and collaborative approach.\n\n- - -\n\n## Get started on your winning sales deck\n\nYou should now have all you need to get started on building beautiful sales decks that can be used to drive deals. But creating a great sales deck is just the start of the journey.

Today, those doors have all but disappeared and been replaced with automated lead generation and sales presentations over Zoom. But one principle will never change: Sales is all about connecting people and their needs to your product and the solutions it provides.\n\nWe’ve compiled a handy list of sales presentation tips to help you connect with prospects and build trust across the digital divide. But first, let’s start with the basics — the sales presentation itself.\n\n## What is a sales presentation? \n\nA [sales presentation](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Sales-Presentations-2ty6p66LNdEx5oL2gj4Vzsd7) is a step in the sales process where sales professionals demonstrate the product or service’s value proposition and use it to convince potential clients. \n\nThe most effective presentations are simple and concise; they tell a visual story of how your product or service can solve your customer’s pain points. Sales decks should be easy to follow, so your audience can focus on the message instead of getting distracted by complex words and images. \n\n## What should an effective sales presentation include?\n\nHow do you tell a good sales presentation from a great one? The best sales presentations are tailored to a specific prospect, but there are a [few key slides](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-structure) that every deck should include:\n\n1. **The problem**. Explain the problem your product or service solves — and the business impact of solving it.\n2. **Prove it**. Include social proof such as customer testimonials, customer logos, or a one-slide case study.\n3. **But what do you actually do?** Give a taste of what your product or service actually does. You can do this with screenshots, a quick demo GIF, or more conceptual frameworks that reflect the market and your place in it.\n4. **The size of the prize.** How do customers benefit from working with you? If you can quantify this with hard numbers or real customer quotes verified by a neutral third party, even better!\n5. **Start a conversation.** A sales pitch shouldn’t be a one-way street. Include a slide tailored to your prospect to spark conversation. Get them talking about their specific challenges.\n6. **Guide the next steps**. Anticipate and address practical adoption questions. An FAQ slide or product implementation pathway shows your prospect the immediate next steps.\n7. **Contact details**. You want to continue the conversation with the prospect, even if now isn’t the right time for them to buy. Remember to include a slide with your contact details at the end.\n\nNow, let’s dive into the specific tips and techniques that’ll help you build and present the perfect sales pitch.\n\n## Win prospects with these 10 sales presentation tips\n\n### 1. Use a sales presentation template to save time and stay on brand\n\nTo move quickly and stay on brand, [high-performing sales teams](https://pitch.com/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams) don’t build their sales decks from scratch. Instead, they use presentation templates that are easy to customize for various audiences and contexts. With a template, you can focus on delivering buyer experiences — not redoing slides every time you need to meet with a prospect. \n\nBuilding a template with Pitch is easy and will help you stay consistent and organized. You can:\n\n* **[Create custom sales templates](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3752837-create-a-template)**. Browse the template gallery or combine slides from different templates to create your own unique sales presentation.\n* **[Organize your sales presentations into folders](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3678628-organize-presentations-with-folders)** so it’s always easy for the sales team to find the right deck. Popular ways to organize are by industry or buyer persona.\n* **[Build sales decks that work offline](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5671537-work-offline-in-pitch)**. Even without an internet connection, you can work on your sales presentation and create a unique version for each prospect.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Deck-5N3sZR7RWppM5toKMn6jNfxi\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665395955/templates-grid/sales-deck.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Proposal-7TzhtL6zL3VC4R4itc4cUVNB\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1665396135/templates-grid/sales-proposal.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:See more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 2. Create presentations that fit into the customer journey\n\nA successful sales presentation centers prospects as [heroes in their buyer journey](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-ideas#5-steps-to-rewriting-the-heros-journey-for-sales) — on a mission to improve their own company by investing in your solution. It demonstrates an understanding of why potential customers would use your product and shows how its features can help solve their problems. \n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oap7m2kTRf8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nBy addressing your audience's actual pains and desires, you’ll prove that you have their best interests in mind. This builds trust that you’ll be there for them after the sale.\n\n### 3. Gather supporting material\n\nTo ensure your sales reps can deliver a standout pitch, you’ll need to provide a few extra components to complement your [sales deck](https://pitch.com/use-cases/sales-decks):\n\n* **Product demos**. Provide training on [how to ace a demo](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-ace-your-product-led-sales-demo) based on everything you know about your prospect’s business, how they’ve used your product, and the challenges they’re trying to tackle. \n* **Question banks or rubrics** to qualify and learn about prospects.\n* **Battlecards with clear grab-and-go messaging** that details the benefits of your product versus the competition as well as succinct ways to explain the product.\n\nYour sales team’s main focus should be understanding a prospect’s needs and how your product can help them. The more resources a sales rep has at their disposal, the more they can focus on listening and responding with the right examples and selling points. \n\n### 4. Collaborate on your sales pitch \n\nYour job is to know your product inside out. Your job is also to have a deep understanding of your customer. And once you’ve got the story that links product and customer, you’re set.\n\nThe thing is, you’re not the only one who knows your product and customer. Your product, marketing, and customer success teams are also great sources of knowledge. And your brand and design team helps make sure you look your best. So to build the most effective sales decks, you need to collaborate with other teams.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nHaving a feedback loop is critical. Customer-facing material should include insights from customer success teams and sales development representatives.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/pocus-Alexa-Grabell.jpg] [name:Alexa Grabell] [role:Co-founder \u0026 CEO] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651486311/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos-Pocus.png] [layout:regular] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIn Pitch, you can collaborate with your teams to create compelling pitch decks. Here are a few ways you can work together to make a winning sales presentation: \n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivczcsxwAuA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n* **[Set slide status and roles](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide)**. Is this slide a to-do, in-progress, or done? And who’s responsible for the next steps? \n* **[Collaborate live with in-app video](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4520554-collaborate-on-slides-via-live-video)**. Stuck on a slide design decision or how to word a value proposition? Get quick input in real time, directly on the slide you’re tackling.\n* **[Leave comments right where you need answers](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments)** to give and get async feedback. For extra flair, use the built-in emoji library.\n* **[Stay on brand with slide styles](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4063049-work-with-slide-styles)**. Your time is best spent perfecting your sales pitch — not doing copy-paste busywork. Have your brand design team create slide styles you can apply anywhere.\n\n### 5. Build rapport remotely\n\nBuilding remote rapport takes more than a virtual handshake. To instill confidence, provide the customer with relevant information, products, and services that make their lives easier. \n\nHere are a few remote conversation tips to keep in mind when building rapport:\n\n* **Be friendly.** Smile genuinely, and use warm greetings and goodbyes.\n* **Really listen.** Absorb what your audience is saying.\n* **Don’t just parrot your sales points.** Respond to prospects’ questions and concerns, and leave pauses for them to speak.\n* **Be a mirror.** Show empathy by reflecting your leads’ tone, body language, and speaking rate.\n* **Make it personal**. Remember, you’re selling to a person, not a company.\n\n### 6. Engage your customer on their terms\n\nOne way to engage your leads is to talk about something they care about. This means doing your homework — after all, [good sales presentations start with research](https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-ideas#5-research-steps-for-building-solid-sales-presentations).\n\n{{component:embed [code:\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOok6-FswM4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [ratio:16:9] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother way to wake up a prospect is to drop a provocative statement. For example, if you’re selling educational software, you might say something like, “Teaching to the test has greatly improved our education system.” Your audience might totally disagree, but it will likely open up an interesting conversation.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nWhen you’re delivering your sales pitch, present some sort of limbic brain messaging to trigger an emotional response. Say something provocative to engage your audience.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:regular] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 7. Be obsessed with customer outcomes\n\nSales reps need to listen to a prospect’s end goals and find ways to solve their bigger problems. So don’t fill your sales presentation to the brim with stats and selling points. Instead, leave plenty of time for questions. This will help you learn about your audience’s desires and barriers, so you can formulate the ideal solution.\n\nAnd be prepared to find answers, even if they fall outside the domain of your product. Imagine you’re selling a tool for business trip planning, and a prospect asks about Covid policies at the Amsterdam airport. That might not be part of the service you’re selling, but finding the answer shows you’re there to provide solutions, not just to sell software.  \n\nThere will always be some clients that take longer to close. But sales is about building relationships. Your job is to work with your buyers until they’re ready to buy. By showing them you're willing to put in the time upfront, they’re more likely to trust that you’ll be there after you’ve closed the deal.\n\n### 8. After you present, follow up\n\nYou nailed your sales presentation. Nice job! But you’re not quite done. The next step is to follow up. With the tools available to us today, that’s easy as pie.\n\n[Share your presentation](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748926-share-a-presentation-with-others) with specific permissions that allow others to either edit, comment on, or view it. You can also [create custom links](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6046701-create-custom-links-to-your-presentations) to make your sales deck feel even more personal. \n\nTo add some dynamism, you can [sell async](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-sell-async-with-pitch) and embed video recordings in your slides. This makes it easy for someone to watch your presentation from anywhere, on their own time. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654780738/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-recordings-embedded-in-slide-deck.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654780722/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-recordings-embedded-in-slide-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:A﻿ video recording of a sales presentation done with Pitch] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnd use [presentation analytics](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5592127-view-presentation-analytics) to keep a pulse on buyer engagement. Track the number of views your deck is getting, and receive a detailed breakdown for specific time periods. This will help you know the prospect’s level of interest when you follow up. \n\n### 9. Learn and iterate\n\nSay your pitch has paid off, and you’ve closed the deal. Again, congrats! You might be eager to move on to your next sales presentation — and success story. But before dialing up that qualified lead, take a minute to learn from the process. \n\nFor instance, have you heard multiple customers say your product is “as smooth as butter?” Consider testing this language as part of your value proposition. \n\nOn the other hand, is your most frequent complaint about how slow your product is? Maybe speed should be prioritized in the next product sprint.\n\n### 10. Revisit and refresh your sales deck\n\nEven the best sales decks need a regular refresh. How often you do this depends on the information you have available and on the rhythm of your teams — but a thorough quarterly review is a good place to start.\n\nYou can easily [assign slides to specific account executives](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) to make sure information is up to date, on brand, and consistent across decks. By building this step into your sales team rituals, you’ll be sure that your decks not only look good, but continue to impress with relevant content. \n\nAnd don’t forget to bring marketing and customer success into this refresh process. These teams can provide invaluable input on what messaging is resonating in the market and offer new case studies to include in your presentations.\n\n## Start building winning sales presentations \n\nNow you know what it takes to build a great sales presentation — and how to support your team in using presentations to build a high-performing sales process and feedback culture. \n\nReady to start crafting your next sales deck? Here’s a selection of professionally designed sales presentation templates that you can use to get started for free. They’re fully customizable, so you can tailor them to your brand and audience. \n\nAnd when you’re ready to share, you can [link to specific slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5599765-link-to-slides), [invite collaborators](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5296293-intro-to-collaboration) into your workspace, and [set a status and assignees](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide). With Pitch, some just might say that going from draft to deck is as smooth as butter. \n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Pitch-57Koq538XwuU5VWRwV4GFcCm\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1666593833/templates-grid/sales-pitch.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/async-sales-deck.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch"],"title":"Shining a spotlight on our beta users","date":"2020-04-09T12:47:50.020Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":true,"author":"Kate Donahue","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lprspotlight_header_small.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lpr_featured.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lprspotlight_header_mid.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lprspotlight_header_big.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lprspotlight_cover.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/lprspotlight_social-share.jpg","tweet-text":"Shining a spotlight on @Pitch's first users: ","teaser-text":"We’re ready to showcase how some of our very first users are using Pitch to raise money, work faster, and communicate more effectively.\n","excerpt":"We’ve been hard at work onboarding our very first users.

Today, I want to showcase some of our top teams and share how they’re using Pitch to raise money, work faster, and communicate more effectively.\n\nA few weeks ago, [we offered a first look at Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/our-plans-for-pitch-in-2020) and shared our plans for 2020. But we didn’t dig into one of the most important topics: our users. Currently, we have more than 200 teams working to pitch their business, stay in sync, and more. Here’s how teams like yours are creating and sharing presentations with Pitch. Plus, we’re introducing a new way to make sure great potential teams [get early access](#great-people-know-great-people-introducing-our-referral-program).\n\n## Supercast created their Pitch-perfect pitch deck\n\n[Supercast](https://www.supercast.com/) is a new platform that helps podcasters leverage their relationship with fans to monetize via audience-support. The product was born from the work of [DoubleUp](http://www.doubleup.agency), a marketing agency that helps startups and content creators build sustainable digital businesses. As the podcasting industry exploded, clients started approaching them to move beyond advertising revenue and explore other monetization models. DoubleUp spotted the opportunity, and Supercast was born.\\\n\\\nWhen co-founder Aidan Hornsby started building a [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-decks) for potential investors, Pitch was a natural fit. He was able to get started from our [library of templates](https://pitch.com/templates) and quickly put together a winning pitch deck with help from Andrew Wilkinson and the team at [Tiny](http://www.tiny.website).\n\n“We needed to be able to go from zero to a version one of our deck. With Pitch, we were able to quickly get a rough idea of the 10 slides we needed. Then, Andrew and I started throwing the link back and forth and sharing ideas in real time.” Within one day, they had the first version of their pitch deck, complete with content, typefaces, and colors.\n\nTo go from first version to final version, the team used Pitch’s collaboration and workflow features to collect feedback, refine content, and track progress through slide statuses.\n\n“One thing I found particularly valuable in Pitch is the ability to clearly mark things as to-do’s and move away from having a dozen slides, each littered with messy comments. Having a quick color reference to see, ‘Okay, slides 1, 2 and 4 are locked down but 3, 7, 10, and 11 still need work,’ helped me navigate the slide deck at different levels while staying focused on what was important.” Aidan could go from sweating the details — *we need a statistic on this slide* — to reviewing the whole deck — *does the story we’re trying to tell make sense*?\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/2_supercast_pab4ah.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/2_Supercast.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSo how’d the pitch go? At the end of February, [Supercast announced a $2M seed round](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/supercast-raises-2m-help-podcasters-make-money-names-new-ceo/) and was able to hire a CEO to bring the platform to market.\n\n## Ground Up Ventures saves time crafting industry reports\n\n[Ground Up Ventures](https://www.groundup.vc/) is an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in pre-seed and seed-stage startups in the United States and Israel. In 2018, they published their first **State of Seed Investing** report, which surveys local investors on the outlook for startups in Israel.\n\nJordan Odinsky, Investor and Head of Platform at Ground Up, led the charge in building the report. In order to get to a finished product, he had to hop between tools like PowerPoint, Canva, and Google Slides (to name a few!).\n\nWhen Jordan got his hands on Pitch, he knew he wanted to use it for the 2019 report. “With Pitch, my job was seamless. There was no more formatting, re-formatting, and triple-checking fonts, colors, or positioning. With Pitch, you can choose a stunning template and customize your presentation in a few clicks.”\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/1_groundup_i3vxw6.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/1_groundup.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHaving access to Pitch and its [library of templates](https://pitch.com/templates) has come in handy outside of generating this annual report. Now, Jordan and the team can create presentations for the Ground Up portfolio, investors, and the wider startup ecosystem.\n\n## ChartMogul keeps their remote team in sync\n\n[ChartMogul](https://chartmogul.com/) helps companies understand and grow their subscription business. In early 2019, the team went fully remote. Ingmar Zahorsky, their VP of Customer Success, was prepared for the shift, as he was already managing a global team of success managers across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\nThe team relies on tools like Slack and Notion for asynchronous updates, but once a month, make it a point to get on a call and go through their success metrics. During this time, they can review and set goals, share knowledge, have open discussions, and make sure they get to connect as people, as well as teammates.\n\nEach team member is responsible for providing an update. When they were using Keynote, that meant having to send files back and forth before assembling the final deck. Now, the team can start working from their template in Pitch, and collaborate and provide updates in one place.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/5_chartmogul_zumxtb.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/5_chartmogul.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAt our first community event, Ingmar shared how Pitch helps everyone keep a pulse on what’s happening at work. “Since ChartMogul is fully remote, it helps to have things in one place to avoid information silos. Pitch makes the information transparent and available to everyone. This is an opportunity to take anything presentation related and centralize it in one place.”\n\n## Artifact created a conference pitch worthy of a standing ovation\n\n[Artifact](https://www.artifact.io/) helps companies warehouse and instantly analyze qualitative data from every stage of the customer journey. In January, CEO Nate Sanders took the stage at [Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com/) to pitch his business to more than 25,000 attendees.\n\nBefore Pitch,[ Nate had tried just about everything](https://twitter.com/nlsanders/status/1189942443124252677) to make the process of creating presentations easier. But he found that every tool came with unnecessary complexity, hindering his workflow. “My whole career I’ve spent too much of my life working in presentations.”\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/4_artifact_kt0vay.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/4_Artifact.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSince joining our beta, the Artifact team has gone all-in on Pitch, even moving items like job offers out of document software and into a presentation. With Pitch, they’ve been able to improve productivity without limiting their creativity when it comes to storytelling.\n\nHis favorite feature? Well, according to him: “It’s kind of a hard question. You’ve taken all these normal-day features that all these other presentation tools have and made them better and easier to use. It’s just better to use than other software.”\n\n## Buffer pitches new ideas to the leadership team\n\n[Buffer](https://buffer.com/) offers a suite of social media products and is widely known for being a fully remote and truly transparent company. Engineering Manager Marcus Wermuth has been a long-time remote work advocate. He started using Pitch because he was looking for a more collaborative presentation tool that placed a premium on efficient design workflows.\n\nRecently, he had the opportunity to speak in front of all people leaders at Buffer and used Pitch to present on the topic of [first team focus](https://www.oreilly.com/content/ask-the-cto-a-peer-manager-is-trying-to-take-my-engineers/), where leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders before supporting direct reports.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/3_buffer_s4u2bc.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/3_Buffer.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nFor Marcus, ease of use is key. “I like the simplicity of Pitch, and how easy and quick it is to put together a great-looking presentation.” It also doesn’t hurt that he can easily add GIFs from Giphy or stickers of our favorite office pup to liven up his less serious slides.\\\n\\\nIn addition to using Pitch at Buffer, he also relies on it to help deliver content for presentations and workshops. (In fact, he delivered a two-hour talk to our team back in February to discuss remote work leadership!)\n\nThese are just a few of the ways teams are using Pitch today. We’re so excited to see more of you switch to Pitch and hear about what you build!\n\n## Great people know great people: Introducing our referral program\n\nUp until now, our criteria for selecting beta users has been straightforward: Are you working with a team? How are you creating presentations today? What type of presentations are you creating? How many people do you work on presentations with?\\\n\\\nBut early on we started receiving ad hoc referrals from some of our more active beta users. Based on current criteria, some of these referrals wouldn’t have been considered a fit. But you know what? Most of these referrals paid off — these users were highly engaged and communicative.\n\nIt should have been obvious: *Of course* our current users would have a great read on who would benefit from using Pitch, and who we could learn from.\n\nToday, we’re making this process official: **Every current Pitch user can refer two companies for early access.** We’ve already sent them the details. If you’re eager to move up the waitlist (and think you’d make a great beta user!), now’s a great time to get in touch with a current Pitch user and let them know.\n\nFor those of you who have been patiently waiting for your turn to try Pitch: Don’t worry. We’re scaling up the number of invites we send each week and are still sourcing teams from our waitlist.

You know it’s going to be the next big thing. Now, how are you going to convince the rest of the world? This is where the \\*fun\\*draising part comes in. To raise money, though, you first need to spark interest with investors. There are two key ingredients in your recipe for success here: your pitch deck and your delivery. \n\nYour [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck) acts as your source material for the story you want to tell. It’s composed of stunning visuals, bold copy, and a clear storyline. But static slides aren’t enough; driving your message home also depends on the right delivery. There’s no fixed formula for a great pitch — but even the most compelling story needs an authentic voice to bring it to life. \n\nThis article will walk you through nine actionable steps to perfecting your pitch and bringing investors on board. You’ll learn to elevate your pitching skills to complement your slide deck and secure the signatures needed to grow your business.\n\n## 1. Develop a simple script and communicate it clearly\n\nEvery effective pitch starts with a convincing story. But smoothing out a complex tangle of facts and figures into an impactful narrative is an art. To develop a tight script where every line and word counts, you first need to have a clear, overarching message that you then break down into the [right structure](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-deck-structure). \n\nReflecting deeply on your business and vision can help you develop a coherent narrative. And transforming the story behind your [business idea](https://pitch.com/guides/pitching/how-to-pitch-your-business#how-to-get-started-on-your-business-pitch) into slides will help you clarify your message. \n\nThere’s a secret to adding an effective voiceover to your slide deck: Keep your language accessible. Imagine you’re explaining your business to a 5-year-old, and go from there. Using everyday words will create a natural flow and help your audience quickly grasp intricate ideas. \n\n## 2. Establish your voice\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1612187118/blog/StP_share.jpg] [alt:A big mic surrounded by presentation elemnts] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYour product or service is unique, and your business model is robust — but so is everyone else’s. Your potential investors want to get to know the team behind the product. In fact, investors often say they [invest in people, not ideas](https://startupnation.com/manage-your-business/venture-capitalists-teams-ideas/). To differentiate yourself from the pack, you need to establish your voice.\n\nEvery entrepreneur is different, so your personal fundraising success will depend on your own authentic delivery. Presenting in front of a potential investor is your opportunity to show them what type of person you are. \n\nIt’s important to convey your passion and show why you’re uniquely positioned to build this business. If you can make your audience like and trust you, chances are they’ll like and trust your idea too — which we’ll look at more next. \n\n## 3. Prepare for your audience\n\nThis step is all about figuring out who you’re pitching to. You’ll likely be presenting to different investor groups, and the specific makeup of each should directly influence how you prepare and deliver your message. \n\nFamiliarizing yourself with your audience yields useful data so you never feel like you’re fumbling in the dark. Your core ideas won’t change, but how you share them will. For example, is the group you’re presenting to big or small? Audience size can determine how personal you get and how much you involve investors in your presentation. \n\nNow consider your audience on the individual level. What are their roles? Do they have any known triggers or special interests? Learn more about your audience’s priorities and needs, try to address their pain points, and anticipate their questions.\n\nTo tell a consistent story that’s tailored to your audience, follow the 80/20 rule for standardization and customization. Use your core pitch deck as an anchor. Then make small personalization adjustments — like adding a relevant slide from the appendix or choosing a GIF that a particular investor might appreciate.\n\n## 4. Tailor your pitch to your presentation format\n\nNow that you know who you’re pitching to, it’s time to think about logistics — the how. The best presentations are tailored to their contexts. Presenting over a video call on Zoom, for instance, has different requirements from an in-person pitch. So first decide on a format that’ll enable you to present your team and product in the best light. And then figure out how to take advantage of the format you choose.\n\nFor in-person presentations, make sure you can be heard by everyone in the room. Consider getting a clicker with a laser pointer so you can focus your audience’s attention, and try to hold eye contact with your audience as you speak. \n\nFor video pitches, your presentation setup is key. Having a clean environment and technical equipment like a light ring will make you seem more professional. Familiarize yourself with shortcuts so you can seamlessly navigate through slides, and focus your gaze on the camera to have more presence on the virtual stage.\n\nUltimately, the format you choose is determined by how you want to come across to your audience. \n\n## 5. Practice your delivery\n\nWhen people get nervous, they tend to get clammy and speak quickly. But there’s a simple technique you can use to avoid the cold sweats and mile-a-minute delivery, and it’s called practice.\n\nMany of the most natural-sounding presentations required lots of practice. That off-the-cuff TED Talk? Its breezy nonchalance is likely the product of hours of preparation. \n\nA great way to practice slide voiceover is through the [recordings feature](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) in Pitch. You don’t need (or want) to memorize everything — again, the goal is to sound authentic, not robotic. Knowing your material inside and out will give you the confidence and freedom to ad-lib if the occasion presents itself. \n\nHere are a few other tips that’ll help you [deliver the perfect pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-deliver-the-perfect-sales-pitch): \n\n* Present your slides without looking at them\n* Time your delivery to stay within the limit\n* Speak in front of people and maintain eye contact\n* Slow down your speech and include pauses\n* Pronounce your words clearly\n\nAs you practice, keep updating your slides and script. You may find that you need to cut sections or shuffle slides around to create the most compelling delivery.\n\n## 6. Involve your team\n\nConstructive feedback is a gift — and your team is there to give it to you. Ask your colleagues to watch your pitch rehearsals and live delivery. They can share tips for improvement or point out unconscious habits that may be distracting your audience. \n\nPeople who join your pitch meetings can also support the preparation process and ensure your presentation goes smoothly. You might be the one delivering the elevator pitch for your company, but everyone you involve becomes a part of the process.\n\nTo work more effectively together, you can use Pitch to collaborate on your deck in real time. You can easily [share presentations and invite specific collaborators](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5695616-share-presentations-and-invite-collaborators). To track progress, you can [set a status or specific assignee for each slide](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide).\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1669990241/blog/9%20steps%20to%20delivering%20a%20standout%20pitch/assigning-slides-pitch.png] [alt:Assigning slides on Pitch] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOr, you can workshop the deck together with [live video collaboration](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4520554-collaborate-on-slides-via-live-video). In the past, founders had to send static slide decks around for team members to check and update, creating a version control nightmare. Speeding up the deck building and iterating process helps you start fundraising that much sooner.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/funding-pitch-deck.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Investor-Pitch-Deck-52NJt62Vk3cZ5g7Hgb3XGSPG\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/VC_Pitch_Deck.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/VC-Pitch-Deck-33Lsdq7J5Cg84ni9Fd632kB8\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore more templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 7. Draft a presentation game plan \n\nWhether you’re an experienced speaker or a total newbie at pitching, one thing’s for certain: You’re not immune to the pre-presentation jitters. The only surefire way to address those nerves is through practice and meticulous preparation. A successful pitch is the result of careful planning — before, during, and after the event itself.\n\nTo build rapport and anticipation, touch base with VCs or [send them your pitch deck](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748926-share-a-presentation-with-others) or business plan ahead of your presentation. \n\nA few hours before you go live, aim to be presentation-ready. This will give you time to collect your thoughts, hydrate, and have that last bathroom run. By the time you finally face your audience, all you’ll need to do is activate your muscle memory to summon your pitch.\n\nWhen it comes to your actual delivery, there’s no such thing as being overprepared. As you step into the spotlight, you’ll feel confident if you know you’re simply executing your well oiled game plan — not scrambling to make last-minute adjustments.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_Recordings.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_Recordings.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 8. Deliver with confidence\n\nYou’ve put in the hard work, and you’ve done all the preparation. If you believe in your idea, you now need to wholeheartedly convey that assurance to your potential investors.\n\nTo project confidence and maximize your chances of getting investor buy-in, practice answering the tough questions, over and over. This will help you hone your responses, be better prepared to face new questions, and stay cool and collected in the heat of the moment. \n\nEven if you know your pitch inside out, it can't hurt to have some extra support on hand. With Pitch, you can [use speaker view](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4301460-add-speaker-notes) to stay organized and feel more in control. You see your speaker notes, time management tools, and all your slides, while your audience sees a polished, full-screen version of your deck. \n\nFinally, start conversations early. Getting to know your audience, involving your team, and recruiting mentors will set you up for success. The more feedback you can get early on, the better prepared you’ll be — and the more confident you’ll feel during your pitch.\n\n## 9. Iterate with data\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1666953540/website/pro/feature-story/presentation-analytics.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1666953553/website/pro/feature-story/presentation-analytics.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nA good business pitch isn’t over until the paperwork is signed — it requires effective, tailored follow-up. You don’t necessarily need to make any changes to your slides after the meeting. But you can [record a polished version of your pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-sell-async-with-pitch) so investors can review it async.\n\nYou can also save a separate version for every investor you present to, and [share that presentation with a custom link](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6046701-create-custom-links-to-your-presentations). Through these personalized sharing links, you can [track when investors view your deck](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics), and invite them to leave comments on individual slides to continue the conversation.\n\n- - -\n\n## Take your fundraising pitch from good to great\n\nAn [impressive pitch deck](https://pitch.com/blog/15-great-pitch-decks-from-successful-startups) doesn’t come together overnight. The success of your presentation relies on preparation and practice.\n\nKnowing your target audience and making micro-adjustments to answer questions and counter biases they may have is key — as is delivering your presentation in a way that’s authentic to you, your company, and your product. \n\nRemember that creating a great pitch isn’t a solitary task. Developing and delivering impactful material takes a village, both in the preparation phase and during the live presentation. Tap into the talent around you to highlight the latest data, ensure your visuals stand out, make your copy sparkle, get feedback on your delivery, and, ultimately, impress investors.\n\n### Build a winning pitch deck with these templates\n\nChoose from dozens of professionally crafted templates to start creating your own successful pitch deck.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/10-Slide-Pitch-Deck-0dh4WE6siodH4gWAjk0og4tB\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654783329/fundraising-guide/10_Slide_Pitch_Deck.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1655886801/fundraising-guide/startup-pitch-deck.jpg\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Discover more pitch deck templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Pitch-deck] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"How to make the switch to Pitch","date":"2021-02-03T08:37:50.520Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Aimee Millwood","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_HeaderMOBILE.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_HeaderSMALL.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_HeaderMID.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_HeaderBIG.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_Cover.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/SwitchToPitch_Social_share.jpg","teaser-text":"We’ve put together a guide to help new teams successfully make the switch to Pitch.

One of the most common questions we hear is, “How can I help my team get started?” After speaking with hundreds of people, we’ve put together a guide to help new teams successfully make the transition. Here are our top tips.\n\nThis guide is designed to help get your team up and running in Pitch, with tips for how to make the case for a new tool and plan your first project. This post includes highlights from the guide, but for more details and a comprehensive overview of how to make the switch to Pitch, make sure to check out the full version in the deck below.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/16dec282-06e6-4c29-95b0-8793a641be9f\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 4 steps to planning your first project in Pitch\n\nThe best way to get familiar with Pitch — and to help your team see how it can improve their everyday workflow — is to start with one real-world use case. Think of it as a pilot project. This will help you directly compare what work looked like before Pitch, and what it might look like after. \n\nHere are our tips for picking a project that demonstrates just how easy it is to create and collaborate in Pitch. \n\n## Step 1: Identify a strong use case\n\nThink about what issues or problems your team encounters with their current presentation software: Is it hard to work together? Does your design team not have enough time to help make presentations look good? Or perhaps it's hard to understand which decks are up to date and approved to use. \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nWhen making the case for a new tool, it’s best to show how it will solve the specific challenges your team faces today.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIdentifying the problems Pitch can most effectively solve for your team will help you pick the right type of presentation for your pilot project. Many teams choose to start with weekly team meetings or pitch decks because they naturally require cross-team collaboration, so everyone can see how much easier it is to work together and share feedback in Pitch. \n\n## Step 2: Assemble your core team\n\nIt takes a village, as they say. And in no case is that more true than when it comes to getting buy-in for a new tool. As you make the switch to Pitch, you’ll want a few people by your side. \n\nEarly on, you should consider inviting a business lead and design lead to join you in the pilot project. In addition to these key stakeholders, you’ll want to bring whoever you’d typically work with on your selected use case. So, if you’re working on a deck for a [](https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Launch-7LaH6K3zqUCL5tBTdq2ZpycR)[product launch](https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Launch-7LaH6K3zqUCL5tBTdq2ZpycR), you’ll want to bring members from every team involved on board. If you’re working on a [partnership proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Partnership-Proposal-6wL7ba0x13Uo5THCdy5ukn5x), involve whoever will be pitching the partner.\n\n## Step 3: Get your workspace ready for your team\n\nWorkspaces help you bring all your presentations, templates, and brand assets together. As you start to make the transition, you and your core team will want to set up a few things so new members better understand what Pitch is all about.\n\n### Create a branded presentation style\n\nThink of presentation styles like design guidelines for your slides. Styles set the defaults for elements like background colors, fonts, charts, shapes, and more. This way, everyone in your team can [create presentations that are both beautiful — and on brand](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips). \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Template_StyleLoopBGCompressed_qzmhjd.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Template_StyleLoopBG_fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe recommend creating two presentation styles to start — a light and a dark version of your core brand — but you can create as many as you like. [Read more about styles here.](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4059534-create-your-own-presentation-style)  \n\n## Step 4: Make your first Pitch presentation\n\nOnce your workspace is set up and ready to go, it’s time to start building your first presentation. If you already have content you'd like to bring over, you can save time by importing it into Pitch before continuing with your [presentation design](https://pitch.com/blog/presentation-design-tips). \n\nThis week we released a beta version of our PowerPoint importer, which makes it simple to move your existing content into Pitch. It works with most .pptx files (meaning you can move over Keynote and Google Slides content too) so you can import basic slides, text, shapes, and images. [Learn more about the importer here.](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4615453-how-to-import-a-presentation)\n\n### Save a brand template\n\nCreating and saving a brand template is the best way to give your team the right tools to make beautiful decks quickly. Templates give everyone a solid starting point to work from, and in Pitch, any presentation can be saved as a template, making it easier to centrally manage changes.  \n\nYou can choose a [template from our gallery](https://pitch.com/templates), create a new one from scratch, or work from an existing presentation. The Switch to Pitch guide above contains step-by-step instructions for how to create your own custom template for your team. \n\n## Share your presentation with your broader team \n\nAfter you’ve successfully created your first presentation, don’t forget to show it off! Maybe you want to present it at your next company all-hands, embed it in your team notes on Notion, or create a Loom walkthrough you can share in Slack. \n\nWhen it comes to Pitch, seeing is truly believing. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/StP_share.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nReady to work on other projects in Pitch?

But according to Alexa Grabell, a product-led sales (PLS) approach can uncover a host of potential customers within an existing user base — your sales team just needs the right tools and insights to reach them. \n\n[Alexa Grabell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagrabell/) is the CEO and co-founder of Pocus, a PLS platform that helps go-to-market teams turn product data into revenue without the need for engineers. It’s a solution for nontechnical sales teams and a tool to cope with a changing buyer landscape. \n\nPLG-driven strategies tend to treat sales as an optional add-on — [sales decks](https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Deck-5N3sZR7RWppM5toKMn6jNfxi) and demos are developed as separate sales enablement tools rather than as a library of integrated solutions that clarify product value for the user. By contrast, PLS takes more of a hybrid approach, where sales teams are able to leverage product data to mitigate churn, prospect more proactively, and find upsell opportunities. PLS teams integrate product data into sales tools, such as their pitch decks and [product demos](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-ace-your-product-led-sales-demo), to make them more relevant and resonant.\n\nIn this Q\u0026A, Alexa shares her insights into the nascent product-led sales landscape. She offers approaches for building effective sales collateral and sales decks, as well as ideas for improving sales processes. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/c2ea75b8-1ff2-4260-8cd8-23e934a18368\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Many people think that PLG companies don’t have sales teams — but you bust this myth in your [go-to-market insights](https://www.pocus.com/blog/the-myth-of-no-sales-at-product-led-growth-companies). Then there’s product-led sales, a hybrid approach that’s still in its infancy. Can you conceptually walk us through how PLG-plus-sales works compared to PLS? \n\n**Alexa:** Many PLG companies that aim to move “upmarket” will add a traditional sales team to their bottom-up PLG motion, where the product speaks directly to the needs of end users. But these companies often struggle to connect the dots between a self-serve motion, where an entire customer journey can happen without any one-to-one interaction between the customer and business, and a top-down enterprise sales motion. \n\nNow compare that to PLS, where you add a sales team to leverage the goldmine of potential customers in your existing self-serve user base. This approach doesn’t simply layer on sales as an entirely separate motion. Instead, you’re equipping sales teams with valuable product usage data about existing users, so they can target the right opportunities with the right message at the right time. \n\n### What are some common PLS buying patterns you’ve encountered? \n\n**Alexa:** The majority of companies in our [2021 benchmark survey](https://www.pocus.com/blog/introducing-the-product-led-sales-pulse-benchmark-survey) said they have some kind of self-serve path for their users — whether that’s a freemium, free trial, or low-cost approach. This signals a broader trend toward adding product interactions earlier on in the user journey. \n\nAnecdotally speaking, we’re seeing more and more traditionally sales-led businesses start to think about how they can offer product interactions earlier in their sales cycle — either through a free trial or freemium product, or even through proof of concepts, pilots, and interactive demos. \n\nWe’re excited to see how this might change in our 2022 benchmark report. Look out for that in the coming months! \n\n### What types of buyers go down the “contact sales” path? \n\n**Alexa:** Most PLG businesses — even the poster children for PLG — still don’t allow customers to self-serve on enterprise plans. You typically have to go down the contact sales path. Almost 58% of the benchmark survey respondents require customers to contact sales for an enterprise plan, while 23% offer both contact sales and a self-serve option. Very few companies (7%) only offer a self-serve path. \n\n### How can sales teams adapt to the changing buyer landscape? Where does an account executive (AE) fit into the buyer’s journey, especially for companies that started out with PLG? \n\n**Alexa:** What we’re seeing with our early customers and companies in the [Pocus PLS community](http://www.pocus.com/community) is the emergence of the sales-assist role. This new front-line role does most of the initial prospecting with high-potential accounts before passing them off to an AE who will take the conversation further. \n\nWe’ve seen this role deployed in a few ways. Some sales-assist teams act more like customer success representatives — their primary focus is unblocking users. Then, they try to identify if someone’s ready to convert into a paid user, add more seats, or move to an enterprise expansion. \n\nA great example is [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), who’s had a PLG strategy for years. They’ve recently started to invest in the sales-assist team to uncover new opportunities within their existing user base.\n\n### Given your new PLS findings, how do sales decks now support this role? What are the key features of these decks? \n\n**Alexa:** In an outbound enterprise sales motion, you’d start with a sales deck that follows a standard format — establishing the problem, solution, proof points, and more. In a PLS world, on the other hand, you really don’t need most of that initial context setting. By the time someone is interacting with a salesperson, they should have already experienced some aspect of the product and have a foundational understanding of the problem and how your product addresses it. \n\nWe see more and more AEs in a PLS world leveraging product usage data to sell to senior-level economic buyers. In this case, a deck should contain more personalized information about how these users have been engaging with the product — and include suggestions for the best ways to sell depending on their engagement.\n\n### Can you walk us through the kind of sales collateral a team might create if they’re moving from, say, PLG to PLG-plus-sales to PLS? \n\n**Alexa:** Let’s assume you’re starting with zero sellers. In PLG, your product and website are the sales collateral. Your website is your best sales development representative (SDR), and your product is your best AE. Together, they should be doing all the heavy lifting of selling the product. There’s probably a product tour, onboarding flow, and some documentation that acts as your front-line support team. Maybe you have a few customer service managers, so there might be some training collateral for how to engage with a user who’s experiencing problems. \n\nPLG-plus-sales might look very similar to traditional enterprise sales. Since this model doesn’t blend the two go-to-market motions, PLG remains the same. However, the sales apparatus would require things like sales decks, demos, discounting policies, and more. \n\nIn PLS, you have a hybrid approach — sales has product usage insights and playbooks that focus on value, not just sales decks and product demos promising new features.\n\n### On a related note, can you share how AEs might shift focus as their companies mature and their sales teams become more sophisticated?\n\n**Alexa:** The number one thing AEs can do to help their companies mature their go-to-market motion is to become more data-driven. There’s a mountain of valuable data and insights that exist outside of conventional sales tools. AEs need to access this information so they can level up their strategy.\n\n### As these [sales teams](https://pitch.com/blog/building-product-led-sales-teams) grow, how can they continue to build materials collaboratively? Do you have any examples of how AEs can get input from SDR or customer support (CS) colleagues to build more informative, tailored decks that close deals? \n\n**Alexa:** Feedback loops are even more critical in a PLS motion. Customer-facing materials shouldn’t just include insights about customers’ actual product usage — they should also highlight any insights gathered from the CS team during their last support conversation as well as SDR feedback.\n\n### How can sales teams become more efficient and effective? Where are you seeing optimizations that translate into deals? \n\n**Alexa:** An internal template on how to get buy-in for your product is becoming essential for companies with a PLS motion. It should include the relevant insights and product usage data points your product champions need to make the case for expansion or upgrades. Templates that share user insights with potential buyers in existing accounts are also a handy resource. They highlight the value that potential buyers are currently getting from your product.\n\n### Finally, can you suggest any sales materials or feedback cycles to help sales teams improve their processes?\n\n**Alexa:** Holding bi-weekly, cross-functional meetings with your product, marketing, and CS teams ensure that insights are shared with everyone. Sales teams usually have invaluable information that can help improve the product by removing friction or improving the messaging. All of this feeds back into the sales collateral and how sellers pitch product value to new customers.\n\n- - -\n\nWant to impress — and convince — new prospects?

From evolving into a complete [pitching platform](https://pitch.com/blog/complete-pitching-platform) to launching our smooth-as-butter video editing features and rolling out countless improvements, we’ve doubled down on helping teams land deals with sleek presentations.\n\nTo celebrate, we’re highlighting ten of our favorite features shipped this year. Big and small, these updates all elevated Pitch to the powerful tool it is today — one that lets you create stunning decks and drive client interactions within a single, unified workflow.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed-link/3cznq8\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 1. Drive deals with customized pitch rooms\n\nPitching materials can easily become scattered when you’re juggling accounts, making it hard for leads or customers to find what they need and for you to stay organized. Enter the pitch room — a customizable space where you can assemble various assets to streamline your clients’ decision-making from start to finish. \n\nThere are endless ways to configure a room: Spin up a digital sales room with pricing proposals and scheduling links to nurture a prospect. Create an onboarding room to welcome new clients with videos and slides. Or deliver creative assets at the close of a project, all in one place. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945572/blog/pitching-platform/blog-pitch-rooms.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNeed some inspo? Check out [one of our own pitch rooms](https://pitch.com/r/pitch-rooms-69prjs).\n\n## 2. Streamline your workflow with a CRM plugin\n\nIf you’re a customer-facing team, chances are you spend a lot of time in your CRM. To make life easier, we created a handy plugin that lets you build a pitch room without ever leaving your workflow.\n\nWith the Pitch app for [HubSpot](https://pitch.com/integrations/hubspot) which has started rolling out to customers, you can create a room directly from a deal, company, or contact record. Once you’re all set, share the room’s link from the CRM, or jump into Pitch to edit your assets. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1731945585/blog/pitching-platform/hubspot-plugin.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis plugin is just the first step of our plan to fully integrate the CRM, so teams with multiple projects and accounts can quickly share relevant content with new prospects. Tell us which CRM should be next — and check out our [integrations directory](https://pitch.com/integrations) to explore how you can connect with tools in the wider pitching stack, like [Calendly](https://pitch.com/integrations/calendly) and [Typeform](https://pitch.com/integrations/typeform).\n\n## 3. Boost your brand presence with custom domains\n\nWhile we think the pitch.com domain’s pretty great, a custom URL can seem even more professional and shows you’re in control. That’s why we made it possible for you to host both your decks and deal rooms on a subdomain of your own site.\n\nThere are many ways to put this to work: Reference the type of content you’re sharing (like pitch.yourname.com or slides.yourname.com), describe your team or relationship to the recipient (sales.yourname.com or partners.yourname.com), or keep it generic (sharing.yourname.com).\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1731945585/blog/pitching-platform/custom-domain.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis highly requested feature not only boosts your brand’s visibility but also reassures clients about the source and authenticity of the deck you’re sharing.\n\n## 4. Tailor your outreach with enhanced analytics\n\n[Presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-presentation-analytics) are one of our most powerful and popular features. Insights like how many people have viewed which slides, and for how long, help teams understand who’s engaged and what part of their messaging is hitting home. \n\nThis year, we enabled you to go even further and [gather person-level data](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5592127-view-presentation-analytics) by prompting recipients to enter their email for access — that way, you know exactly who’s viewing your content. Simply send the link off to your prospect and get notified when they visit the room, open a deck, or click on an attachment.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731945571/blog/pitching-platform/blog-room-analytics.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe also introduced analytics for entire pitch rooms so you can broaden your understanding of what’s working, and what needs tweaking. Just like with individual presentations, you can create a link for a room, name it, and add a passcode for extra security. The [links overview](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5132455-see-all-your-team-s-links-in-one-place) lets you manage all your rooms in one place so you can easily tailor your follow-up and improve your messaging.\n\n## 5. Make your videos pop with fresh editing tools\n\nVideos are a great way to personalize a presentation, engage your audience async, and provide more context without crowding a slide with words. And in 2024, a fresh batch of editing features made them more attention-grabbing than ever. \n\nYou no longer have to let standard aspect ratios constrain your slide layout. Crop your video to any size you need, trim the length to focus on what matters most, and select a thumbnail that captures the video’s vibe.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1734525139/blog/Top%2010%20things%20we%20shipped%20in%202024/blog-cropping-video.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nHaving second thoughts about your edits? No worries — you can [recover the full video](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4539328-upload-videos-to-your-presentation) at any time by cropping or trimming it again. You can also seamlessly replace a video while maintaining its original position and design, like a shadow or rounded corners.\n\n## 6. Engage your audience with interactive embeds\n\nTired of the same old decks with headlines, bullet points, images, and the occasional chart? Yeah, us too. That’s why this year, we gave you the tools to break free and embrace the creative potential of the latest tech. Now you can tell a richer story with less effort by embedding content from thousands of external sites into your slides. \n\nMaybe you’re in sales and need to deliver a [Storylane](https://www.storylane.io/) demo of your product, lock in a follow-up call with [HubSpot](https://pitch.com/integrations/hubspot)’s meeting scheduler, or share a [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) survey. Or you’re a designer who’s created a cool animation with [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) or wants to present a prototype with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Either way, interactive elements bring your decks to life and open up new angles to engage both clients and team members.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1731947708/blog/pitching-platform/form-embed.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nCheck out even more ways dynamic embeds can help you [design standout decks](https://pitch.com/blog/design-standout-decks-with-dynamic-content) and [win deals](https://pitch.com/blog/win-deals-with-interactive-sales-decks).\n\n## 7. Animate decks with slide transitions\n\nWe’ve always been about design excellence, but slides were static when we started out. As such, they weren’t able to fully capture the dynamic ideas and stories teams wanted to tell.\n\nSo in 2022, we introduced the [focus effect](https://pitch.com/whats-new/introducing-the-focus-effect-in-the-player) as a way to highlight one visual element at a time. Then in 2023, we unlocked [enter and exit animations](https://pitch.com/whats-new/make-things-disappear-with-exit-animations) — as well as [continuity](https://pitch.com/whats-new/introducing-pitch-2-0), a slide transition that lets you magically animate related content from one slide to the next with a single click.\n\nBuilding on these releases, in 2024 we added a set of [simple yet stunning slide transitions](https://pitch.com/whats-new/slide-transitions-and-highly-requested-updates) that help you guide your narrative. Effects like fade, slide, and grow let you create more engaging decks and focus your audience’s attention.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1734524832/blog/Top%2010%20things%20we%20shipped%20in%202024/SlideTransitions.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 8. Use variables to align your decks’ content\n\nManually updating a deck for a new client is tedious, time-consuming, and easy to mess up. But guess what? It’s also a thing of the past. Now you can quickly personalize your slides and get them in sync with [variables](https://pitch.com/whats-new/sync-text-across-slides-and-organize-assets). \n\nAdd smart placeholders so teammates can automatically change content across an entire presentation for different customers, build flexible headers and footers that stay consistent across slides, and keep key information up to date.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1734524936/blog/Top%2010%20things%20we%20shipped%20in%202024/blog-variables.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis small but mighty feature makes deck creation faster and less error-prone, so teams who repeatedly pitch to multiple prospects can finally create flawless decks at scale.\n\n## 9. Organize your assets into collections\n\nThis year, library management got an upgrade. Goodbye sifting through endless files, hello streamlined efficiency. You can now [group content](https://pitch.com/whats-new/sync-text-across-slides-and-organize-assets) — like templates, images, videos, and fonts — into named collections, making it easier than ever for your team to find the right assets.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1734525024/blog/Top%2010%20things%20we%20shipped%20in%202024/blog-library-collections.mp4] [poster:] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis feature’s a game changer, especially if you’re managing various teams or juggling different clients. And creating a collection is super simple: Just go to the dashboard, click **Manage library** in the dashboard’s sidebar, open the three-dot menu on the top right, and select **New collection**.\n\nThat’s it! Your content is now neatly organized and ready to use.\n\n## 10. Control template access to protect your brand\n\nOur [Pitch gallery templates](https://pitch.com/templates) come with beautifully designed and cleverly organized slides, offering a great starting point for any presentation. Still, there may be times when you’d rather your team stick to templates built in-house, whether it’s to meet specific client requirements or maintain consistency across the board.\n\nIf you’re the owner or admin of a workspace, you can now [hide templates](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4056913-find-and-use-templates) when creating a new presentation or adding slides in the editor. Just select **Workspace settings**, scroll down until you see **Hide Pitch gallery templates**, and toggle that option on.\n\nThis way, you’ll rest easy knowing your team is always working with approved, on-brand designs.\n\n## 2025 and beyond\n\nAs we near the end of 2024, we’re reflecting on where we came from, and where we’re going. You could say we’ve exceeded last year’s aim to help teams “share bigger, bolder ideas with dynamic decks that match their ambitions.” But we’re not stopping there. \n\nIn 2025, we’ll keep pushing forward with exciting new features to solidify Pitch as the complete pitching platform — think teamspaces to reflect your organization’s structure, more interactive deal rooms, and editing tools that’ll make Pitch even more powerful.\n\nSo [stay tuned](https://pitch.com/whats-new), keep the feedback flowing, and we’ll keep going full throttle."},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"Top tools to automate remote B2B sales","date":"2022-06-29T07:26:31.716Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Matt Roskovec","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400043/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Header_MOBILE_Automate_w800.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400044/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Header_SMALL_Automate_1200.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400044/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Header_MID_Automate_w1440.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400043/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Header_BIG_Automate_w1920.jpg","image-description":"Top tools to automate remote B2B sales","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400043/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Automate_Ledgy.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400043/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Social_share_Automate_Ledgy.jpg","teaser-text":"The right tech stack can make or break your sales targets.

To meet prospects where they are and hit your targets, it’s more crucial than ever to have the right tech stack.\n\nOur team faces the same challenges. So we’re curating a selection of indispensable tools to help you simultaneously work with more prospects, shorten your sales cycle, and increase your conversion rate. These tools have been vetted by sales leaders and growth marketers with over a decade of experience in software sales at Stripe, Apple, Kevin, and Paddle.\n\n## Build a pipeline of prospects and qualified leads\n\nIf you’re working in a sales-led organization, you’re probably no stranger to identifying and reaching out to leads through [LinkedIn Sales Navigator](https://business.linkedin.com/en-gb/sales-solutions/cx/linkedin-sales-navigator?src=go-pa\u0026trk=sem_lss_gaw\u0026veh=LSS-S_EMEA_ROE_T3_EN_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_FieldLP_SalesNavigator_Brand_Exact_459645429756__linkedin%20sales%20navigator_e_c__\u0026mcid=6844049490551300300\u0026cname=LSS-S_EMEA_ROE_T3_EN_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_FieldLP_SalesNavigator_Brand_Exact\u0026camid=1599940730\u0026asid=60541825855\u0026targetid=kwd-310899651265\u0026crid=459645429756\u0026placement=\u0026dev=c\u0026cid=7016Q000000nE8b\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_LVZWV9iAncoXEcRYfcihDnM-bLmEEESlCCiVd5VHn8SWEj6kM79qAaArh2EALw_wcB\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds). However, if you run a product-led business, people come to you first. Qualifying them means evaluating their need for your product, the size of the revenue opportunity, and their purchase intent.\n\nYour marketing page signup conversions are the first indication that people need your product. Ask more qualifying questions in the signup flow to understand these leads better. You could build a custom form for this, or use a third-party solution like [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/). Adding extra steps will likely cause drop-off, so offer a customized onboarding flow or a personal demo as a reward. You’ll learn more about your customers, and your customers will learn more about your product — it’s a win-win!\n\nNext, you need to know which companies your signups are coming from so you can decide where to focus your sales outreach. To automatically enrich signups with firmographic data, we recommend platforms like [Lusha](https://www.lusha.com/), [Hunter](https://hunter.io/), or [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/). Setup requires a sales operations engineer, but once it’s active and you’re driving traffic to your site, you’ll save time by prioritizing the right leads. If you don’t have an engineer on hand, check out [Pocus](https://www.pocus.com/) — a new product-led sales platform (currently in beta) that helps nontechnical teams uncover sales potential based on product data.\n\nNow it’s time to figure out your leads’ purchase intent. The best way to do this is by asking more questions through conversational marketing platforms like [Drift](https://www.drift.com/) or [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/). If you offer a freemium plan or a free trial, make sure leads engage with your product before you message them. Focusing on people who’ve experienced the value of your product — your product-qualified leads — will increase your win rate.\n\nOnce you’re done using quantitative and qualitative data to pinpoint contacts with the greatest sales potential, plug in a sales engagement platform like [Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/) or [Reply](https://reply.io/). These tools will help you scale your outreach through automation and optimize it with personalization and A/B testing.\n\n## Create engaging presentations for your demos and proposals\n\nWe know you’re busy — but so are your prospects. Instead of inviting them to a call via email, which can lead to a lot of back-and-forth, send them a link to your [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) or [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com/). That way, they can book the time that suits them best. Make sure your scheduling tool automatically shares a call link to avoid causing friction (and drop-off). Tools like Zoom, for instance, integrate with Calendly to automatically create conference call links. You can also schedule video conference calls with [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) or [DemoDesk](https://demodesk.com/).\n\nThe call is your chance to get creative. To make your demo worth your prospect’s time, go over some general questions — What’s their main pain point? How familiar are they with your product? — and then shift their focus to your presentation. Provide context on what makes your product unique and how it can solve their problem. If you’re looking to spruce up your sales deck, [Pitch](https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales) can help you create beautiful presentations that’ll keep your prospects attentive and interested. If you’re sending a proposal async, [record yourself talking over slides](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) so your prospects can engage with your presentation in their own time.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/async-sales-deck.png\"}, {\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Simple-Sales-Deck-7TPRBe4bud9z576qVR3RQpVE\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/simple-sales-deck.png\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:See more sales templates] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/collections/Sales] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Track the progress of your sales pipeline\n\nAfter the call, you’ll need to log your prospect somewhere secure and report the deal status to your management team. Most of this work can be automated in a customer relationship management (CRM) system. \n\nSelecting the right CRM comes down to your company size. If you’re an early-stage startup, you can [track your deals manually in Notion](https://www.notion.so/templates/pitchs-sales-deal-room). However, if you need to divide sales opportunities between a larger team of sales reps and do a more detailed pipeline analysis, consider a dedicated CRM tool like [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/), or [Close](https://www.close.com/). Your scaling plans should also inform your choice — migrating an entire customer database will become more complicated and sensitive as your company grows. \n\n## Close deals and sign contracts\n\nIn the end, what really matters is closing the deal. And that means getting someone to sign on the dotted line — fast. Two of the best tools for obtaining an eSignature are [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/) and [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/). \n\nAfter closing the deal, don’t forget to celebrate! At Pitch, we use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to send updates on closed deals from HubSpot and revenue movements from [ChartMogul](https://chartmogul.com/) to Slack. This way, our entire team can enjoy wins together.\n\n## Learn from past calls to improve your performance\n\nYour past sales calls can yield valuable information, such as which selling points resonated best with your prospects. But who has time to listen to hundreds of calls? Luckily, tools like [Avoma](https://www.avoma.com/) or [Gong](https://www.gong.io/) can automatically transcribe calls, and they use AI to identify frequently occurring patterns. Topics like competitor mentions, objections, pricing negotiations, and feature requests are automatically categorized and analyzed so that sales leaders can quickly understand what compels and deters prospects. \n\n## Reinforce best practices with sales enablement solutions\n\nNow that you’ve set up a system to get relevant customer insights, you can create messaging and collateral to help your sales team sell better. Of course, you’ll also need a place to store all of your decks, one-pagers, and battle cards so they can be easily accessed and updated. \n\nIf you’re working in an enterprise business and have a dedicated sales enablement team, sales content management systems like [Seismic](https://seismic.com/) or [Highspot](https://www.highspot.com/en-gb/) can help make collateral available on demand. But not every team has the budget or capacity to set up and roll out such a tool.\n\nMost companies need a simple, scalable way to equip their sales team with the latest messaging and brand guidelines. One way to provide this is through an approved presentation template. [Pitch](https://pitch.com/) makes it easy for teams to collaborate and stay visually consistent. When sales reps need to put a new spin on a deck, they’ll already have a template that includes the latest product visuals and messaging. Instead of having to worry about images and copy, they can spend their time tailoring the deck to each client. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656400044/blog/Top%20tools%20to%20automate%20B2B%20sales/Inline_image_Automate_w1200.jpg] [alt:Pitch library for presentation templates and brand assets] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/blog/manage-your-brand-in-the-library] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Perfect your pitch\n\nOnce you’ve found the right tools, it’s time to work on nailing your pitch!

But the company’s meteoric rise hasn’t come without growing pains: As the team grew in numbers and started to connect with big-name potential customers, delivering a consistent, on-brand, and up-to-date sales presentation became increasingly unmanageable. Something needed to change. By making the switch to Pitch, Unsplash was able to to move past their collaboration challenges and focus on growing their business.\n\nThe founders behind Unsplash started with a simple concept: Every 10 days, they shared 10 free, high-resolution photos on their Tumblr. The idea caught on and since then, the Unsplash library has expanded to include more than 2.5 million images that have been downloaded almost 3 billion times.\n\nUp until recently, all of the photos came from their community of photographers. But in 2019, they unveiled [Unsplash For Brands](https://unsplash.com/brands), a new offering that would create great opportunities for everyone. Using this model, Unsplash could partner with relevant companies, offering them the chance to be featured natively in Unsplash photography or to hire Unsplash contributors to produce original photography highlighting their products. \n\nThis meant native advertising for brands, a new revenue stream for the community creators, and a growing library of free photos, making it a win-win for all involved. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Big_image_Unsplash_1_w1200.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## With a new offering comes new challenges\n\nWith partners like Google, Harley Davidson, and Square already on board, the next step was to create a sales team and figure out how to scale. And that team needed to create [sales decks](https://pitch.com/templates/Sales-Deck-4vTA5b5XHWXD4kRD7X4UJL8F) and[](https://pitch.com/templates/Partnership-Proposal-6wL7ba0x13Uo5THCdy5ukn5x) [partnership proposals](https://pitch.com/templates/Partnership-Proposal-6wL7ba0x13Uo5THCdy5ukn5x). At the time, Unsplash was using Keynote, but the collaboration experience couldn’t keep up with the needs of a fast-moving startup. \n\nCharles Deluvio, a graphic designer at Unsplash, was brought on board to build out their first official company presentation, which soon became the actual pitch deck the team was sending to brands and partners. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Small_image_w800_Unsplash_-_4.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPeople around the company began using — and modifying — Charles’ original deck, and before long, there were literally hundreds of iterations on Dropbox. \n\n“I’d see all these versions and be like, ‘Wow, this doesn't look like our original design.’ We joked it was sort of like a pizza. We started out with a cheese pizza, and then all of a sudden there’s olives and pineapple on top.\"\n\nThere were a lot of people involved in the creation and distribution of presentations, but the process was broken. Working across multiple versions meant they often deleted presentations and started from scratch instead of iterating and improving on existing content.\n\n“Every time the team started working on a new presentation, the opportunity to make a better sales pitch was lost,” Charles says. “There was no easy way to carry over ideas from previous versions.” \n\nTheir way of creating presentations wasn’t just a pain, it was holding them back from improving as a business. Their sales team was eager to move past the tech challenges of creating pitch decks and focus on winning deals, and the designers were desperate to create a more efficient workflow.\n\n## A new tool, but at what cost?\n\nAfter jumping on an onboarding call to learn more about Pitch, Charles could see the value, but wasn't sure if he could motivate the team to try a different tool.\n\n“I personally invested so much time in learning Keynote, creating hundreds of templates in the process, so  it felt wrong to seek out a new option. On top of that, the team had become familiar with Keynote,” Charles says.\n\nCharles came to the realization that if Unsplash’s existing approach already wasn’t working, it definitely wouldn’t work for them as they grew. It was clear that the friction and inefficiency the team was feeling was only set to get worse. \n\n“For us to scale to the size that we envision and reach the objectives that we set out for ourselves, we all knew we needed to adapt our process,” Charles says.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n“Ultimately, we needed a tool that was designed for collaboration.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Enter Pitch: A single source of truth\n\n“When working on presentations, I find one of the most challenging things to do for a graphic designer is to work in tools that aren't as powerful as what they're used to.”\n\nCharles was familiar with Figma, which has a shared library and components, but this wasn’t how it worked in Keynote. Unsplash employees would mix and match from other templates, and there was no way for designers to ensure consistency. Charles found Pitch more intuitive. \n\n“It's very familiar to how designers work in Figma,” he says. “With Pitch, people can start working on their slides and pull from approved templates. Being able to do this in real time and in the cloud makes the entire process seamless.”\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"We needed one source of truth. That's why Pitch worked for us.\"] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPreviously, if someone asked Charles to refine a presentation, he would have to download it and work locally. There would be two people working on two slightly different files simultaneously, updating copy in one, design in the other. There were no processes in place to decide who should be creating the final version. With Pitch, not only was everything in one place, but commenting and assigning slides streamlined their workflow. \n\nHaving centralized, cloud-based storage and folders to organize work makes it easier for everyone to find the latest files. With iCloud and Dropbox, Unsplash always had to be mindful of storage limits. With Pitch Pro, Unsplash enjoys unlimited file size uploads and unlimited storage in their workspace. \n\n\"As soon as you work on a pitch for a client, it lives in a folder and is accessible. Everyone can see it in their workspace.\"\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Big_image_Unsplash_3_w1200.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Making the switch to Pitch\n\n“I knew that if I wanted to change the process, the transition from one tool to another needed to be seamless,” Charles explains. So, he asked his teammates which templates they were using the most for their pitches and recreated them in Pitch. \n\n“I put together a short presentation on why we should be moving from Keynote to Pitch, outlining all of the issues we faced internally and how Pitch would solve them. It didn't take much time for the team to start using Pitch as their preferred tool for creating presentations.” \n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\n\"With Pitch, real-time collaboration is finally possible.”] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nNow, the team can easily customize and share their sales deck without the headache of endless file versions and confusing back-and-forths. They were able to build on existing decks and ensure that improvements were carried over from one iteration to the next. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a17f11a2-7734-43dc-a775-e140dd404717?player=true\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border: 0;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:wide] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n“As we focus on growing Unsplash For Brands, one difficulty we've encountered has been in designing multiple presentations simultaneously,” CMO Chris Liverani says. “Using Pitch, we've been able to solve this pain point, and that's directly contributed to the growth of our business.”\n\n## Accelerating workflows with the Unsplash integration\n\nOn the team’s journey to becoming expert presentation creators with Pitch, one feature came particularly naturally to them: selecting visuals for slides using the built-in integration with the Unsplash.\n\n“Something that used to be super time consuming when working on a presentation was updating the visuals. Pitch's integration with Unsplash makes the process so much simpler,” Charles says. \"One of the ways we use Pitch is to show partners or brands how their assets would look on Unsplash.\" \n\nThis means they're constantly swapping images in and out. Before, they would have to go to Unsplash, download images, and then upload them to Keynote. Now they can select an image and easily replace it without breaking their flow. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/blog/Big_Video_Unsplash_5_background_o31pwz.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/blog/Big_image_Unsplash_5_fallback_w1200.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Real-time collaboration that can keep up with Unsplash\n\nToday, Unsplash’s team has more than quadrupled in size, and half of the company actively makes presentations. With Pitch, everyone’s able to access the latest versions of decks in a single, centralized workspace, and they no longer have to chase collaborators for comments and follow ups. \n\nEverything happens in one place, and it’s always up to date. \n\nCan they see themselves going back? Using legacy presentation tools feels like a step back, Charles says. “It's so outdated, like sending a fax instead of a Slack message.\"\n"},{"type":"category","title":"Voices","excerpt":"","slug":"/blog/voices","content":""},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"What makes a presentation successful: An 11-step checklist","visible-title":"What makes a presentation successful: An 11-step checklist","date":"2023-05-17T08:07:55.795Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Sarah Kiefer","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693150/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Header_MOBILE_What_makes_a_successful_presentation_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693150/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Header_SMALL_What_makes_a_successful_presentation_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693150/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Header_MID_What_makes_a_successful_presentation_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693150/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Header_BIG_What_makes_a_successful_presentation_w1920.png","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693151/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_What_makes_a_successful_presentation.png","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683693151/blog/What%20makes%20a%20successful%20presentation/Social_share_What_makes_a_successful_presentation.png","tweet-text":"Feel lost when it comes to presentations?

Presentation skills, for instance, can make or break a career — but how many of us were actually taught how to build a deck? And even when we're lucky enough to get feedback, it can be super specific, like “You need to add a source,” or weirdly vague, like “Can you just make the whole thing a bit more… sexy?”\n\nEspecially in the world of business, presentation-building skills are a must-have, whether you're a seasoned executive or just starting out in your career. A great deck can help you win over new clients, convince your boss to take a chance on your idea, and even inspire your team to work toward a common goal.\n\nThere are a lot of different reasons you might need a presentation. Here’s my simple checklist for creating a deck that delivers every time.\n\n## 1. Lead with intention\n\nClarity and connection are key to winning people’s hearts. It’s important to show that you have a clear agenda — and that you understand your audience’s needs, interests, and pain points. A little empathy can go a long way here. \n\nStart your presentation with a straightforward message that can be conveyed in just a sentence or two. You could write this message on a slide, or share it in your live delivery. For instance, you could say, “When we spoke last week, I heard that you’re frustrated with your current CRM. After this presentation, you’ll better understand our CRM’s features and I’ll know more about your challenges, so we can both decide if there’s a fit.”\n\n## 2. Capture hearts with storytelling \n\nPeople love stories. So to capture hearts, your deck needs to have a clear narrative, regardless of the subject matter. The most basic story structure — and the one I use most often — is:\n\n1. Situation\n2. Complication\n3. Question\n4. Answer\n\nTo see how this story structure works, check out the first five slides of [Paddle’s Series D deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Paddle-Series-D-Pitch-Deck-71v8Gw5Q6LDz5XAwDu3x2U5v?slide=27262bbd-a499-4804-8aff-3b0e3200c4f4), the first half of [Pocus’s sales deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Pocus-Sales-Deck-5HZp2j23CLBT5Cehtz5rjoyQ?slide=34b6d7c9-89f1-4d69-bf40-bd4f97327644), or the intro to [Kyle Poyar’s deck on usage-based pricing](https://pitch.com/presentations/How-to-Scale-With-Usage-Based-Pricing-4xKtH6094zeW5uCNQT4sWPrR?slide=577486fa-efae-44e7-a11e-7972c921d399).\n\nIf your topic is more complex or inspirational, and you want to take your audience on a real trip, try [The Hero’s Journey](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/writing-101-what-is-the-heros-journey) structure instead.\n\n## 3. Set your headlines, then get into specifics\n\nTo build your story, start by getting your structure in place. Write out all the headlines of your slides, and check that they form a coherent narrative when read sequentially. Then jot down the information you’ll show on each slide to prove the statement in the heading, whether it’s a more detailed explanation, a chart, an infographic, or a quote.\n\nThis pitch deck from startup [FORMEL Skin](https://www.formelskin.de/) shows how headlines can drive a clear story in just 8 slides.\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/6b6b4555-953b-4c95-8fe0-9fcb5e8346db\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 4. Prioritize visuals over text \n\nThere’s a reason you’re using a presentation format instead of email, or a doc in Google or Notion, and it probably has to do with aesthetics. You’ve chosen a visual setup, so make the most of the design possibilities!\n\nThe simplest, quickest way to make a beautiful deck if you’re not a designer (and even if you are) is to start with a template. In Pitch, we have dozens of [free, professionally designed templates](https://pitch.com/templates) to choose from. They’re versatile and very easy to adapt to your company’s brand for consistency.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1619690597/templates-grid/startup-pitch-deck.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Startup-Pitch-Deck-4gHom74N2VxS4oekfg3YUsVd\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Moodboard-5DY6Ys7Cuw8u5nydUH6946Nn\",\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1619690597/templates-grid/moodboard.png\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore the gallery] [href:https://pitch.com/templates] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you want to design a deck from scratch, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Colors:** Aim to have no more than three or four colors throughout your deck, and be consistent about how you use them for headings, backgrounds, and body text.\n* **Fonts:** Pick fonts that match your message and tone, and never use more than two per presentation — otherwise it’s confusing and distracting. Also, be ruthless with minimum font sizes. Your headlines should be at least 32pt, subheadings 24pt, body text 20pt, and sources 18pt.\n* **Images:** Simpler is better. Crop and zoom in on the part of the image that illustrates your point to avoid surrounding clutter. Make sure any overlaid text is legible.\n* **Layouts:** Every slide design element should have ample breathing room. Use layouts consistently for section breaks, chart and commentary slides, and other standard slide types.\n\nNeed some design inspiration for your slides? Check out [this roundup of the winning entries](https://pitch.com/blog/9-creative-presentation-designs-dribbble-playoff) from a presentation design competition we ran with [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) last year.\n\n## 5. Avoid bullet points\n\nUnless your deck is specifically designed for async consumption, bullet points should be used sparingly and kept concise.\n\nRemember, there’s no hard limit on the number of slides you use; the real limitations are the amount of time you have to present and the attention span of your audience. For short decks, if an idea is complex enough to require multiple, long bullet points, it deserves either a separate slide (if you’re presenting live) or a proper body of text (if you’re sending over a deck to be read). \n\nSee how [Front](https://front.com/) breaks up their ideas into more slides in their [Series C deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/Front-Pitch-Deck-5HdwRF4mfGJ34o3AQz5tk1Cn?slide=48dbf7eb-4024-4419-8fa9-aff708667238). You could also use design to distinguish between ideas, like in [Spendesk](https://www.spendesk.com/product/)’s deck below.  \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/fb8d4e2b-1610-402a-8864-bd10f0e498e0/3e8f86ae-9c1d-4fd0-b1c4-fb72a7097c5f\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 6. Charts and data should captivate, not confuse\n\nMake an effort to source the data, case studies, and other information that will win over your audience with logic rather than just emotion. It’s usually the most time-consuming part of building a presentation, but you can convince even the most pedantic person if you make an effort with detail and accuracy. \n\nKeep charts as simple as possible. Strip out complex backgrounds and unnecessary axis labels and lines. Highlight what matters with color and overlay labels. Title your data and charts clearly, and always include sources with links. You can use infographics when presenting one or two standalone statistics as these will be easier to grasp than bare figures. \n\nFor inspiration on simple but effective presentation of data, check out Azeem Azhar’s Exponential Age presentation below and Ben Evans’s [The New Gatekeepers](https://www.ben-evans.com/presentations). \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/f2a7fb79-c8dc-41f4-a15d-b01c5c8574fa\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## 7. Give your audience a map\n\nMost people are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information coming at them daily and need a framework so that new ideas stick. Help your audience keep track of where you’re taking them by giving them the lay of the land. In other words:\n\n1. Tell your audience what you’re going to tell them.\n2. Tell them the story.\n3. Tell them what you just told them.\n\nThat might seem like a lot of repetition — but your audience will feel clear about the destination, have context on the information you’re delivering, be more likely to grasp the core message, and be able to find a resolution when the promised destination is reached. For a more in-depth blueprint, check out these resources on [structuring pitch decks](https://pitch.com/blog/pitch-deck-structure) and [board reports](https://pitch.com/blog/how-to-write-a-board-report).\n\n## 8. (Pre)read the room\n\nPeople’s moods and receptivity to information are contextual. Carefully consider the environment in which your audience is going to experience your presentation. Are you sending the deck as a preread for folks to look through in their own time? Are you on stage in front of hundreds, or on a Zoom call for three? \n\nIf the dominating emotion is likely to be impatience, you need a tl;dr or executive summary slide. If you’re presenting after lunch and the audience will be nodding off, how can you jolt them awake? Maybe it’s time for a shocking stat or eye-catching image.\n\n## 9. Align your format to your delivery method\n\nIf you’re presenting in person, you can get away with very little text, lean heavily on imagery, and even [go full Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg).\n\nIf you’re presenting asynchronously — for example, to a team spread across multiple time zones — you can [embed a recording of yourself in your deck](https://pitch.com/use-cases/video-presentation-maker).\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_Recordings.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654163411/use-case/create-better-board-decks/Editor_InvestorDeck_Recordings.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf your deck is read-only, or a preread, you’ll need text to do the narration for you. In the preread case, consider creating two versions of your deck — a text-heavy one to send out ahead of your meeting, and a leaner iteration you can present live. \n\n## 10. Pause for a break \n\nYou don’t want your audience to feel like they’re sitting through a lecture or reading Moby Dick. The key here is to… pause. That means inserting some kind of break at least every 10 slides. Here are some ideas: \n\n* Ask a question, and call on the audience to answer.\n* Use section breaks to punctuate your flow.\n* Run a poll, even if it’s just a show of hands.\n* Take five minutes, and have the group jot down their thoughts on a Post-it.\n* Embed a video or GIF that highlights your point with humor.\n\n## 11. Always include a call to action and next steps\n\nYou gave your presentation because you want something to happen, right? So many people fall at the final hurdle and fail to clearly state what happens next, leaving a convinced audience unsure of what’s ahead. But there are ways to avoid this.\n\nFor starters, include a clear ask [like this seed-stage company does at the end of their deck](https://pitch.com/presentations/terrible-Pitch-Deck-5RwkyX4M7Ros5ZZYSv3nZZPF?slide=b253da12-952a-4b67-a3ae-f8bc29d16545). The more specific the ask, the better. It might be a detailed pricing proposal, like in [Studio Treble](https://www.studiotreble.com/)’s [penultimate slide](https://pitch.com/presentations/Studio-Treble-Portfolio-2epWff4nCW7s4VxCeM6kNo38?slide=c5e25ab1-5ff3-4ace-9a95-1c1e6b138d2b), or a timeline mapping out next steps. Also, be sure to put in your contact details for later reference. You can keep it subtle, like the last slide in [MAD](https://mad.ac/)’s studio deck. \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/d612e7c6-f700-4303-983d-eaa052527430\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"368\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n- - -\n\n## Power up your presentations\n\nCreating a great presentation takes time and effort. The good news is, your deck isn’t a one-trick pony. Start with a strong foundation, and then reuse those designs, layouts, templates, styles, and even entire slides wherever possible. \n\nLike with everything, you’ll learn what works through trial and error. Test out your presentation on a lower-stakes audience — friends, family, colleagues, and even investors — before you face prime time. Leverage [presentation analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRHL5rXpWM0\u0026t=4s) to learn if prospects have opened your deck, which slides are resonating, and whether anyone has actually done the preread. \n\nAnd when it comes to presenting, don't forget to practice, practice, practice. It’s the only way to calm those presentation jitters. There's nothing like the high of nailing it — you'll see.\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1656402846/templates-grid/async-sales-deck.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Async-Sales-Deck-4b5mkm2vzXfa4Sju8F2XUWge\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1619690597/templates-grid/team-bulletin.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Team-Bulletin-4LHZR30w7ycz4dfQZK0cJtae\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Sign up for free ] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Inside Pitch"],"title":"Why we redesigned Pitch before we launched","date":"2020-08-13T09:10:34.166Z","indexed?":true,"author":"Axel Herrmann","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header_mobile_ramsaxel.jpg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/header_small_ramsaxel.jpg","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headermid_axelrams.jpg","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/headerbig_ramsredesignaxel.jpg","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover_ramsaxel.jpg","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/social_ramsaxel.jpg","teaser-text":"Not many companies redesign a product before they launch.

Usually, they come after reaching a tipping point of feedback that proves something just isn’t working right. Rarely do products do a full-on redesign before they’ve even been launched. Here’s why we — in the midst of our beta — rolled out a redesign of the core product experience, and how we made it work.\n\nWhen it comes to designing our product, we’ve always pursued a combination of aesthetics and functionality. Sure, we wanted to make sure Pitch looked sexy and felt fun to use, but we also wanted to nail the right combination of speed, efficiency, and straightforward UX.\n\nWhen we were in the very early stages of developing Pitch, [we partnered with MetaLab](https://www.metalab.co/projects/pitch). We wanted them to challenge our initial assumptions about how the product should look and feel. They became an extension of our internal design team during this time, helping us to conduct user research and bringing new perspectives about the product’s design.\n\nWe ultimately considered this project a success and ended it confident in the direction we were going. So why, just a year out from launching our product, did we decide to redesign the product from the ground up...again?\n\n## **Why we did it: The reasoning for a redesign**\n\nDuring the project with MetaLab, we worked many months ahead of the actual implementation process, and after using our product internally and getting real-life feedback from our early beta users, we saw that a few things weren’t working as we’d expected. The dissonance between our design vision (what Pitch could be) and the reality ([how users actually experienced Pitch](https://pitch.com/blog/why-you-should-develop-features-people-dont-ask-for)) made it even more obvious that certain areas just weren’t getting it right.\n\nEveryone was excited about the visual appeal of Pitch, yet it felt like we missed the opportunity to challenge the core of the product and make Pitch a tool that offers a simple UX and works fluently across all devices — now, and in the future.\n\nWe want Pitch to be modern, not just in how it's designed, but in how we interact with it. That’s why we've always tried to think one step ahead by including initial concepts of future features, like animations or analytics, very early on in the process. Designing for the iPad generation, we knew we needed to consider how the user experience on mobile and touchscreens from day one, not just as an afterthought.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nWe’re not just designing for today, but for tomorrow.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe didn't set out to make a better PowerPoint, and we aren’t just trying to incrementally improve presentation software. We really want to redefine how modern teams create and collaborate on presentations, from the ground up.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/rams_before_after_final_sniinh.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/rams_before_after.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## **How we did it: Organizing the workflow and task force**\n\nWe began the project with three main goals in mind: Make Pitch faster, increase user engagement, and make it easy to create beautiful slides. We agreed that each product component we planned to redesign should impact these goals to some extent. To make sure we were designing in the right direction, we split the features and assigned them to a single goal to make it easy to verify our hypotheses.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/image-1200-valuation.png] [alt:weighing the value of redesign] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis notion of forming hypotheses and then following up on them proved to be one of the most important parts of our process: It kept us on track and accountable, ensuring that the work we did had a real impact on the goals.\n\nAt Pitch, we work in teams that are responsible for a certain area of the product. Each team is like a gear that enables the entire product development process to run like clockwork. With a core team formed of cross-functional stakeholders from leadership, product management, and product design, this redesign project was a different sort of task force, one that came with its own set of challenges.\n\nTaking designers' time away from their usual teams and work came with the risk of slowing down the process of current feature development. Keeping everyone up to date and involved when they were spread between their usual day-to-day work required coordination and concerted attention to transparency. And in order to make the process efficient, we had to find the right level of detail between a rough wireframe or a fully polished feature. This was a constant balancing act: For some components, we needed to create detailed designs, while for others, we only defined an entry point or provided a walking skeleton.\n\n## **Challenges: Balancing between radical simplicity and user needs**\n\nWe quickly found that balance was important not only in how we worked, but in what we wanted to achieve. Going into this project, there were quite a few unknowns, but one of the things we were sure of was that it would only work if we were able to find the sweet spot between a simple interface and functionality.\n\nWe’ve been using the same presentation software for years, and over time, we’ve gotten used to the way they work, even if that means making sacrifices and trade-offs. You can either have a cluttered interface that provides a lot of features or trade feature depth for visual appeal and simplicity. We believe Pitch should be both: Simple, but also simply powerful.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nSimplifying a product isn’t easy, especially when you’re building for such a diverse spectrum of user needs.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nInstead of iterating from the current state of the app, we took a drastic step and made a radical design, which became the basis for discussion, feedback, and iteration. It was a bit like a concept car in automotive design: Start with something extreme and then soften it around the edges to ultimately present a car that everyone can buy (and love).\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/rams_inline_zoom_final_rcwalx.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/rams_inline_edit.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThis was one of the very first layouts from the redesign. It was quite drastic, as we removed all of the UI aside from the slide itself. When thinking about user flows, this design felt too radical. Looking back, it's fair to say that the inline editor for text is our redesign in a nutshell, metaphorically. \n\nWith the inline editor we basically made the decision to optimize Pitch for users that aren’t skilled designers by focusing on simple tools that offer the giving easy-to-use tools to the people who will use Pitch on a daily basis.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/image-800-inline-editor.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe used text as one of our areas to benchmark if we were getting the balance right between simplicity and functionality. Why? It's a staple in most presentations, yet at the same time, working with text — and designing an inline editor for text — surfaced a lot of opinions on preferences and must-have options. It was about finding balance and accepting trade-offs.\n\n## **What we learned**\n\nApproaching a redesign is never easy, but especially when you need to keep up the current pace of your other feature work. We tried many different internal processes as we approached this project. Here are a few that proved most successful:\n\n### **Do user research, early and often**\n\nWe tested early designs with Pitch employees both in dedicated sessions, as well as diary studies. We also received input from our beta users and other presentation creators. But beyond just testing, setting clear hypotheses and success criteria was key.\n\n### **Involve a dedicated developer to prototype ideas**\n\nSetting up prototypes via design tools alone doesn't expose all flaws of a concept due to the constraints it comes with. Also testing is more limited, because the user would follow a certain map instead of exploring free range.\n\n**Make the process transparent and open**\n\nWe held weekly feedback rounds with stakeholders that were open to everyone so that anyone could review progress, provide feedback, and challenge assumptions throughout the process. We also added slides to our [weekly team bulletin](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins) so that everyone would be kept up to date.\n\n### **Break out work for product teams and monitor progress**\n\nOne of the biggest lessons we learned is that it’s really easy to go too far. It’s critical to always sync and prioritize efforts based on the roadmap, otherwise you begin designing for the future, but end up with a version fit for 2050, not 2020. By always coming back to the reality of the roadmap, it's easier to identify the areas that need a lot of detail work and those that only need to be a walking skeleton. This also ensures all resources (people and time) can be managed more efficiently.\n\n## **The big reveal**\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/1200-pitch-nao.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:wide] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nSo what’s final product look like?

People think they’ll be happy if they win the lottery (even though studies prove that isn’t true). \n\nSo, if just asking users doesn’t work, how do we actually uncover our users’ unmet needs? It’s not just about “eating your own dog food” or “drinking your own champagne.” It’s also about building empathy and weaving user research into the fabric of your company culture. At Pitch, we're always challenging ourselves to address the root cause of the problem, not just manage the symptoms.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/kevinspost_si1.jpg] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## You’ll never know what users want just by asking\n\nIf you ask most people what they want, you’ll get front-of-mind problems — whatever is most obvious in that moment to them. But often, it’s really the workarounds that have become ingrained in people’s habits that illuminate opportunities for innovation, and they’re the ones that people can’t even remember. As an example, while observing how people created presentations, we saw that they needed a way to communicate to their other teammates whether the slide was incomplete or ready. \n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/kevinspost_si3.jpg] [alt:slide statuses pitch vs. powerpoint] [caption:How people used to show the status of a slide] [layout:normal] [link:] [link-new-tab:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOne user was manually marking slides with their status. It was something so straightforward, but when we looked further, we saw many people taking a similar approach. This even ended up inspiring one of our users' favorite features today: slide statuses. This just goes to show that the things people spend the most time battling with are not features we ever get requests for. It turns out many things we take for granted — like the ability to align objects easily — are surprisingly complicated in traditional presentation software, even though they're a staple in other tools we use today.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/kevinspostvideo_dsptmx.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/status_fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Silent shadowing\n\nObserving how people actually navigate and use their software will teach you much more about their needs than just asking them how they work. We got some volunteers to record themselves making presentations, and watching hours and hours of people struggling with PowerPoint really hammers home the point.\n\nWe try to understand existing user behaviors and expectations early on in feature development to make sure it's represented in the final result. By the time we get to prototypes, whether or not we want to admit it, our ego has come into play. It’s actually a good thing — it shows we’re proud of what we made. But it’s a bit like the IKEA effect, you’ll like something more if you made it with your own hands. And unfortunately, that effect can be blinding. In fact, it’s one of the most dangerous things when it comes to building a product. No one likes to kill their darlings.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nNeeds aren’t static, they change all the time.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nPrioritizing early user research has not only helped us build features like slide statuses, it’s also shown us entirely new ways Pitch can bring value to our users, like [our quick menu](https://pitch.com/blog/from-counter-strike-to-keyboard-shortcuts). Most people were not asking or expecting to be able to have a command palette in their presentation tool, but we saw an opportunity to bring that into Pitch based on the other types of software people rely on.\n\n## Friday presentations: How we use Pitch at Pitch\n\nAt Pitch, we often have discussions about how we think users will behave or expect a feature to work. However, we’re not always creating presentations in our day-to-day job. There are a few ways we test new features internally to put us in the user's mindset. One of my favorites is our Friday presentations. \n\nThis exercise in \"eating our own dog food” has a simple premise: Choose any topic, make a presentation about it using Pitch, and note any feedback, suggestions, or bugs at the end. Doing this helps get you out of what you think people need, and see what you actually need when you’re really making a presentation.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/website-images/uploads/fridaypresentations_py1xst.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/fallback.jpg] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThey’re totally voluntary, but typically, new employees do one shortly after joining. This is not only a valuable way to get product feedback from people who bring fresh eyes and a newcomer’s point of view but it’s also helpful in onboarding new employees. The informal structure of the presentation helps us get to know them better and breaks the ice with the team.\n\nWe like Friday presentations because they're fun, light, and interesting. We've gotten to learn about everything from pineapples and Kimchi to volcanoes in Europe and how people perceive graphs. But beyond just learning new things, Friday presentations are a way for us to gather ideas for features our users may need. Some teammates have even hacked together new features as part of their presentations. For a presentation about Japanese noise music, our UX prototyper Jelle created an early version of what would later become Pitch's video embeds.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nBut, like any other method, dogfooding has its own set of limitations.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe may be getting feedback on the process of creating a presentation, but we could be missing out on other valuable user experiences, like what it’s like to get started with Pitch. To combat this, we use Pitch not only as our internal presentation tool, but also as a way to store and share knowledge like our employee handbook, org chart, and [our weekly updates](https://pitch.com/blog/all-hands-team-bulletins). Diversifying the ways we use Pitch helps us avoid blind spots we would otherwise miss.\n\nOf course, there are always exceptions and gaps. One of the biggest is the ways different people in the company use Pitch. For example, as a designer, I don't use charts or tables very often in my everyday work. Because I'm not exposed to this feature on a regular basis, I may not be as familiar with a user's pain points. \n\nPlus, most of the time, we only create presentations when we have a specific goal in mind. Maybe it’s a pitch deck to raise a Series A, or maybe it’s an end-of-quarter presentation for the department. Regardless, few of us create presentations just for the fun of it. By making Friday presentations light, we give people the opportunity to explore the product and to play with features they may not use otherwise.\n\n{{component:blockquote [text:\n\nIt’s difficult to understand how we’re different to other people.] [footer:] [layout:big] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWe tend to vastly underestimate the differences between us and other people, which is why it’s just as important to try to know your user as it is to know how you're not like your user. This is why it's so important to use a combination of methods to really get the most comprehensive view of users' needs.\n\nEven someone with the same background as you might have a completely different usage pattern. For example, a designer in a small startup has extremely different needs than a designer in an insurance company. Beyond the role or type of company, the surrounding context and user’s mindset in that moment have quite a big impact on their needs. Are they making a conference talk or a [weekly SEO report](https://pitch.com/templates/SEO-Report-5xZdZD0FvgdS4mRDru3m5fGW)? Do they just want to complete the presentation efficiently and move on to their next task, or to really invest in the design for an important conference talk by the CEO?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe all know understanding the people you are building your product for is extremely important. Especially when your product is in an early stage, slight changes in direction can add up to monumental costs if features are developed that users don’t need or want.\n\nIdentifying users’ unmet needs is more than just necessary, it’s a growing opportunity for us as professionals. Often it helps us re-remember things we've heard before, inspires new ideas or ways of thinking about things, and shines a light on the blind spots that may be getting in our way. Not only that, but it improves our intuition and helps us think differently, ensuring that we can build a product experience that builds on existing behaviors where relevant and creating new ones where we can innovate.\n"},{"type":"blog","category":["Presentation Resources"],"title":"Win deals with interactive sales decks","date":"2024-08-13T08:25:39.017Z","indexed?":true,"dont-recommend?":false,"author":"Maresch Bär","mobile-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478150/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Header_MOBILE_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks_w800.png","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478149/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Header_SMALL_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks_w1200.png","mid-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478147/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Header_MID_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks_w1440.png","wide-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478158/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Header_BIG_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks_w1920.png","image-description":"Pitch’s embed button surrounded by 3D illustrations representing video, scheduling, etc.","thumbnail":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478145/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Cover_thumbnail_420x300_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks.png","thumbnail-description":"Pitch’s embed button surrounded by 3D illustrations representing video, scheduling, etc.","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478145/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/Social_share_Win_with_interactive_sales_decks.png","meta-image-description":"Pitch’s embed button surrounded by 3D illustrations representing video, scheduling, etc.","teaser-text":"Including dynamic elements in your sales decks — whether it’s to demo your product, schedule a follow-up meeting, or share a survey — opens up new ways of engaging and converting prospects.","excerpt":"For years, sales decks have been stuck in a visual rut of headlines, bullet points, images, maybe a chart or two… Yawn.

It’s time to shake things up and transform your presentations with the latest tech.\n\nWith Pitch, you can craft a compelling story by embedding content from external sites directly into your sales deck. Including interactive elements — whether it’s to demo your product, schedule a follow-up meeting, or share a survey — opens up new ways of engaging and converting prospects, both on a call and when sending out your presentation as a powerful, standalone sales tool.\n\nLet’s look at some of the ways you can embed content into your sales deck to generate excitement, reduce friction, and guide your leads across the finish line.\n\n## Introduce your product with a dynamic demo\n\nProducts are typically demoed through in-person presentations that are conversational but time-consuming, or through passive (read boring) video monologues. An interactive demo is the modern solution: it allows you to scale your sales pitch while offering a memorable, tailored experience. You show off your product in the best light and save time overall. Prospects feel valued and can explore relevant features at their own pace. Win-win.\n\nWith an interactive product demo, you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you want. Automating your demo entirely is useful for smaller deals where time is a premium. For larger deals, you might jump on a call to introduce your product — then embed an interactive demo into your sales deck so other stakeholders can get a dynamic overview.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478840/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/demo-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478812/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/demo-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTools such as [Storylane](https://www.storylane.io/), [Guideflow](https://www.guideflow.com/), [Arcade](https://www.arcade.software/) and [Supademo](https://supademo.com/) allow you to customize your product demo to the specific needs and interests of each prospect. You can also track interactions to tailor your follow-up and onboard users with step-by-step guides. Meanwhile, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/prototyping/) and [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/xd/get-started.html) are geared toward presenting prototypes of upcoming product features.\n\n## Personalize slides with videos\n\nEver struggled to capture your in-person charisma in a sales deck? Luckily, you can now bring your slides to life with videos. Whether you’re embedding a personal message or a polished product overview from your marketing team, videos are a quick and effective way to provide context and keep prospects interested.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478825/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/video-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478827/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/video-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) and [Vidyard](https://www.vidyard.com/) are specifically designed to create both internal and external sales-focused content for everything from sales enablement to marketing campaigns. [Wistia](https://wistia.com/) shines when it comes to branding and detailed video analytics. For a wider reach and more public sharing, platforms like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/creators/youtube-create/) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) are your best bet. \n\nOr, skip the middleman and [create an engaging video recording directly in Pitch](https://pitch.com/use-cases/video-presentation-maker).\n\n## Showcase detailed documents\n\nSay you want to share a detailed proposal or present a forecast on your expected ROI. Sometimes the slide format just doesn’t provide enough space. And this is where being able to embed information-heavy documents comes in handy. \n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478833/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/document-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478810/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/document-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTraditionally, you might have added a link to your doc or spreadsheet. But in doing so, you’d lead people away from your deck — and divert their focus. In Pitch, you can simply embed a document into your slide to keep the experience seamless and ensure the most current version is always displayed.\n\nThe same goes for PDFs or other documents stored outside your presentation. You can easily integrate files from [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/) to keep everything streamlined and up-to-date.\n\n## Schedule meetings seamlessly\n\nSales meetings — they’re a big deal. When a sales development rep sends out a deck to potential leads, the aim is to get them to book a discovery call or a demo with an account executive. After that first meeting, it’s all about scheduling follow-up calls to loop in other members of the buying committee and keep things rolling.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478825/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/meeting-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478827/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/meeting-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEssentially, you want to eliminate any barriers to booking a meeting. So embedding a scheduling page like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) or [HubSpot Meetings](https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/schedule-meeting) into your sales deck can be a game-changer. \n\nThat way, prospects can quickly reach out to a salesperson or a tech expert if they get stuck. And when your prospects move forward, the deal moves forward.\n\n## Demonstrate ROI with a built-in calculator\n\nImagine you’re on a call with a prospect, and you’re helping them figure out if your service is a worthwhile investment. Instead of doing some obscure math in the background, you both fill in the details together to see the pricing or ROI right there on the screen. Pretty cool, right?\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478815/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/calculator-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478821/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/calculator-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAdvanced form builders like [Fillout](https://www.fillout.com/), [involve.me](http://involve.me), and [Outgrow](https://outgrow.co/) let you create calculators for just this purpose. It’s a great way to keep things transparent and interactive during the call. \n\nDepending on the complexity of your pricing, you can also share these calculators as embeds in a standalone deck for prospects to use on their own. That way, they can easily answer questions like, “How much will I pay for this?” or “Is it really worth it?” at their convenience.\n\n## Finesse your follow-up with feedback surveys\n\nKnowing your audience helps you sell more effectively, tailor solutions to their needs, and focus on the most promising leads. That’s why lead enrichment is so important — it helps you collect information to make prospects feel heard and turn the sales process into a true dialogue.\n\nPitch integrates seamlessly with all the common form providers, enabling you to embed surveys and feedback questions into your slides. Best of all, if you connect the forms to your CRM, the lead information syncs straight to your contact or company records.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723478825/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/form-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723478566/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/form-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThere are tons of platforms you can use to gather insights.

But interactive elements can do more than impress clients — they’re also great at enhancing internal decks for training and knowledge-sharing purposes.\n\nTake [Gong](https://www.gong.io/de/sales-training-software/), for instance. It records and analyzes sales calls with AI, letting you pinpoint your top meetings. You can then embed replays of these high-impact calls into your slides to train new reps and share best practices across your team.\n\nOther sales enablement tools like [Scribe](https://scribehow.com/solutions/sales-ops-enablement), [Useful](https://useful.app/), [Allego](https://www.allego.com/), and [Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai/) [](https://scribehow.com/solutions/sales-ops-enablement)also let you create videos, guides, and training materials that you can embed right into your deck. This way, you’re not just improving your external sales process but also empowering your team from within.\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1723488285/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/training-embed.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1723488279/blog/Win%20deals%20with%20interactive%20sales%20decks/training-embed.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:wide] [transcript:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n## Capture and convert leads with your next deck\n\nNow that you know what it takes to build a great sales deck — and how to foster a high-performing sales process and feedback culture — are you ready to start crafting your winning presentation? \n\nTo kick-start your deck, [sign up for a free Pitch account](https://app.pitch.com/?signup) and choose a professionally designed template from our gallery.

Pitch decks need to be tailored to the company’s stage, industry, and target audience. This introductory chapter summarizes experiences from successful founders, as well as tips from investors who’ve outlined the key ideas they’re looking for.\n\n## 1. Know why you’re raising investment capital\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics of building a pitch deck, let’s look at why investment capital may be a strategic next step for your business. Why are you looking for angel or venture capital investment, and why now? \n\nMost likely, your goal is to achieve rapid business growth. Entrepreneurs normally need access to capital to grow the team, whether it's for product development or customer acquisition. But keep in mind that venture capital is just one way to raise money. For example, [companies can bootstrap](https://pitch.com/presentations/Dado-Pitch-Deck-3SK8yr59QXA45cSmqg5eBQPk?slide=a4485b3b-e7f2-484c-a9f0-7ea8d8e09535), take out a loan, [receive institutional funding](https://pitch.com/presentations/SUPERRR-Lab-Pitch-Deck-36xiRN69cCzR5Aw7KN5UadJd), and [even crowdfund an investment round](https://pitch.com/presentations/Treatfuls-Pitch-Deck-6ggjV67RAfti5kJYS36tUBGr). \n\nBefore you start working on your slides, you’ll need to have a concrete product roadmap and go-to-market strategy to justify the amount you’re raising from investors. You’ll also need to be able to show how investment will fuel growth and, ultimately, business value.\n\n## 2. Understand the fundraising landscape\n\nWhile venture funding in 2021 broke records across the board, 2022 has seen a sharp market downturn. The [economic downturn](https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-downturn-tech-industry-layoffs-stock-plunge-funding-slowdown-2022-6) means that with investors becoming more selective about their investment portfolios. These tough conditions will also forge resilient startups with efficient operations, sound scenario planning, and strong business models. Honing a business pitch that highlights the discipline investors are looking for today will help startups continue to secure funding in the coming years.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nUnderstand which investors focus on your sector and your company stage.

This guide features voices from founders in underrepresented groups as well as from venture capital firms intent on diversifying their portfolios. Startups can — and should — choose which investors they approach for funding. Focusing on the ones that are relevant to your business and aligned with your vision will set your company up for success long after you close your round.\n\n## 3. Answer three essential questions to start your pitch\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that raising venture capital is the best route for powering your startup’s growth, it’s time to focus on crafting a pitch that resonates with investors.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nStarting with the ‘why’ lets you build the business case for your product.

Who is your investor audience?\n2. Why are you interested in working with that particular investor?\n3. Why should this investor fund your business? \n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nThe most important questions to address in a pitch deck are the market opportunity and vision: Why this approach? How does it differentiate from competitors? Why this team?] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654086607/fundraising-guide/Mark_Kraynak_-_Founding_Partner_-_Acrew.jpg] [name:Mark Kraynak] [role:Founding Partner] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654092710/fundraising-guide/pitch-fundraising-guide-acrew.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen sharing your business idea, be careful not to take an investor’s interest for granted. Your pitch deck needs to help an investor make sense of the market’s size and your product’s unique potential. Instead of overwhelming your audience with a deep dive into your business plan, focus on clear, relatable storytelling. Introduce the pain points your customers face, outline how your product solves their problems, and explain why users are willing to pay for that. In a few slides, you should be able to clearly illustrate to investors:\n\n* Who your customers are \n* What their problem is\n* How your product solves their problem\n* Why this target market has value potential\n\nMany pitch decks are too long. So remember, brevity is your friend. To start, you can look through over 90 pitch decks in our [Female-Founded Startups collection](https://pitch.com/presentations/collections/Female-Founded-Startups-6W5Xze7LB8o85KvJhf4hn3j8) to see how others tell succinct stories that answer essential investor questions.\n\n### Early-stage startups\n\nIf you’re raising pre-seed to Series A funding, your deck should focus more on your founders’ stories, evidence of your potential customers’ pain points, and your team’s unique skill sets. Showing traction where possible, such as early user growth or a first client contract, will convince investors your product has revenue potential. \n\n### Growth-stage startups\n\nIf you’re raising later stage funding, you’ll need to demonstrate consistent growth. At this stage, investors are looking at key metrics and traction. They want to know how a leadership team is thinking about the company’s position in the market, approaching learnings from the last year to plan for the coming years, and envisioning their product and GTM evolution to accelerate revenue.\n\n## Provide evidence and accurate business data\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654002688/fundraising-guide/pitching-guide-revenue-chart_w1200.jpg] [alt:A deck built in Pitch showing hypothetical monthly active users.

This is where you’ll need to get input from your co-founders or wider leadership team. Specifically, that might mean obtaining revenue information (actual and projected) from your CFO, your go-to-market strategy from your CMO, and input from your CTO or CPO about product roadmap and strategy. \n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nNarrow down your points to emphasize the key messages and KPIs in your pitch deck.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654086605/fundraising-guide/Lucia_Payo_Molina_-_CTO_Co-founder_at_ExaktHealth.jpg] [name: Lucia Payo Molina] [role:CTO and Co-founder] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654092710/fundraising-guide/pitch-fundraising-guide-exakt-health.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMake sure you have evidence for each aspect of your business, from financials to product differentiation.

Lay out revenue metrics and MRR or ARR milestones if you’re on track to reaching them.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nIn the early stage, it’s important to showcase your strengths and your product.

The short set of slides illustrates how Pitch works and its unique value in the world. Finally, the story concludes by showing which customers and investors have already joined the Pitch journey. \n\nAs you finalize your pitch deck, think about how you can simplify your story. Move your supporting slides, such as those that do a deep dive into your marketing strategy or revenue model, into the appendix section for reference. Distill your slides — and your message — until you have a crystal-clear elevator pitch that anyone could follow.\n\n## Present with the KISS method\n\nOnce you have polished slides, it’s time to go out and pitch. The key to success is practice — and more practice. Spend as much time on your script as you have on your slides.

It helps your audience follow along and understand the content of your deck without getting distracted by jarring design elements. \n\nYou can maintain this consistency in two ways: templates and styles. Let’s look at their main differences, and when to use each one. \n\n### Templates: Pre-designed slide layouts\n\nA deck template is a series of slides or styles that you can save and use over and over. If you’re just starting out in the world of presentation design, templates are your best friends. Because they’re predesigned, you don’t need to figure out how to do the visuals yourself. But they can also serve as a springboard for inspiration and customization if you do want to dive in.\n\nTemplates keep slide layouts consistent across presentations, which is especially important when you’re working in a team. Anyone can duplicate the full deck, and then delete or customize slides where necessary. \n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1674824569/blog/Aesthetic%20presentation%20templates/communication-plan-template-cover.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Communication-Plan-2JobAp2azMqf4yR6sj26om66\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1674824131/blog/Aesthetic%20presentation%20templates/press-kit-template-cover.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Press-Kit-4vxq8V04agMk5g3CGP4A2A7b\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore the gallery] [href:https://pitch.com/templates] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTake advantage of the many [free presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates) available, which cater to a variety of brand styles and moods.

Which fonts are you using for headers and descriptions? What is your deck’s color palette? \n\nKnowing the answers to these questions will help you build your own scalable style.

Applying it to your presentations can be the difference between dull and engaging for your audience. \n\nTo start, let’s get reacquainted with the color wheel. First up are complementary colors, which are opposite each other on the wheel. Use them to draw attention to specific elements on your slides. Create harmony in your presentation by bringing together analogous colors — those that sit side by side on the wheel. By adding white to a true color, or hue, you can create a lighter tone, or tint. Similarly, add black to create darker tones, which are called shades.\n\n### **2. Select an effective color palette**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a6894a38-9e1e-4b2d-afe4-26628af8d15f/390eacd6-8fc3-445c-8336-0a395bb0bea4\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:] [spacingBottom:] [spacingSize:]}}\n\nYou don’t need to paint a rainbow on your slides to make them look beautiful. You really just need two to four colors that work together in harmony. \n\nLet’s take a look at a few color-pairing strategies.\n\n**Monochromatic palette** \n\nThis method consists of a single hue that’s rendered in various tints and shades. With only one hue, you may think you’re limited — but you'll find that less is more. Simple elegance is the name of the game here.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683189583/presentation-guide/Chapter%202/monochromatic-template.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Resume-Green-5gkEAK0mqt8m56nA3J2hv8kd] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Resume-Green-5gkEAK0mqt8m56nA3J2hv8kd] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Analogous palette**\n\nAn analogous palette involves using three colors that are beside one another on the color wheel. This strategy evokes a low-contrast design that’s easy on the eye.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683189584/presentation-guide/Chapter%202/analogous-palette.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Virtual-Conference-Talk-0MWmTu2UrfKy56Ghhj5Zwrdk] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Virtual-Conference-Talk-0MWmTu2UrfKy56Ghhj5Zwrdk] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n**Complementary palette** \n\nIf you want to be sure to catch your audience’s attention, then a complementary color palette is the way to go. Two hues on opposite ends of the color wheel naturally have a high contrast, which in turn creates high impact.\n\n{{component:image [src:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1683189583/presentation-guide/Chapter%202/complementary-pallete.png] [alt:] [caption:] [layout:normal] [link:https://pitch.com/templates/Crayon-6AFYXV0zhEPk5MFLBs7DLnAc] [link-new-tab:true] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Use this template] [href:https://pitch.com/templates/Crayon-6AFYXV0zhEPk5MFLBs7DLnAc] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### **3. Choose the right fonts**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a6894a38-9e1e-4b2d-afe4-26628af8d15f/300f73a4-b4f2-40ef-bd62-09f605f2514e\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:] [spacingBottom:] [spacingSize:]}}\n\nThere are two basic types of fonts: serif and sans serif. Serif fonts have decorative lines called “tails” or “feet,” while sans serif fonts don't have these flourishes. [Research shows](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3502222) that this difference can affect how your audience reads your presentation.\n\nSerif fonts are generally considered more traditional and authoritative. Books and magazines tend to use serif fonts for lengthy body copy because they’re more legible in small sizes. Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, are more modern. They work well when the copy is short or the space is limited, like on signs, maps, and in apps.\n\n### **4. Consider the personality of fonts**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a6894a38-9e1e-4b2d-afe4-26628af8d15f/46ed1d25-44a0-49ca-b45d-a080c0e7a9e8\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEach font has its own personality. Choose the one that best embodies the topic of your presentation. Trying to sell a new, hipster product? Choose a playful font. Pitching your sleek design services to a potential client? A more elegant typeface might do the trick. \n\nKeep in mind that your fonts also need to be consistent with the overall vibe of your presentation. You can mix and match fonts to make a point, but be sure to use them discerningly.\n\n### **5. Limit the number of fonts**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/a6894a38-9e1e-4b2d-afe4-26628af8d15f/27a33748-0a00-45c9-8d74-96dca07733ee\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:] [spacingBottom:] [spacingSize:]}}\n\nWhen it comes to presentations, the golden rule is to never use more than two fonts. You typically need just one font for your headlines, and another for your body copy. Having too many typefaces is like having too many people in the kitchen — things get messy. If you’re not a professional graphic designer, or want to be extra safe, stick with a single font. \n\nAnd we know the urge is there, but to emphasize text, don’t type it in all caps — no one likes to be shouted at! Instead, try using bold, italics, or color to give your words some pizzazz."},{"title":"Elevate your deck’s design with some simple rules","content":"Creating a polished style or template for your presentation doesn't require you to be a design genius.

Make sure your headline tells the right story\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/0edeec8e-0f48-4711-96ce-6408275b7c5c\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYour headlines are the first thing your audience will see on each slide, so put in the time to make them as captivating as possible. A confusing headline will leave listeners equally confused — and disengaged. \n\nIt goes without saying, but your headlines should accurately reflect your message. They need to be clear and concise, especially on slides that contain a lot of data or visuals. The goal here is to capture your prospects’ attention and keep them engaged throughout your talk.\n\n### 2. Treat presentations as visual aids, not documents\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/1449821c-89b2-4997-a0c8-1a91139c967d\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nEver found yourself losing focus during a presentation because the speaker’s slides were overloaded with too much information? You may have started to zone out or read along, both of which are red flags.  \n\nSlides should be visual aids — not documents. To keep your audience engaged, you need to find the right balance between text and images. Limit the number of words on each slide, and use images and other visual data to support your message. This doesn’t mean you need to omit important details. Just put them into your presentation script, not your slides.\n\n### 3.  **Lay out bullet points like paragraphs**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/a719a930-385a-4190-b695-4113e187f896\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you need to deconstruct a complex idea, use bullet points to break it down like you would in a paragraph. Create a bullet point for every major argument, and then support these ideas with indented bullet points outlining the details. \n\nRemember to give your ideas room to breathe. Adding enough space between your bullet point sections will keep the ideas distinct and make your slides look neat and tidy.\n\n### 4. **Avoid these six common typographical errors**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/5699cb7b-f265-498a-8926-a066fd46308a\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs outlined in the [design chapter of this guide](https://pitch.com/guides/presentation/design-your-presentation), consistency is key when it comes to presentation visuals. The same goes for the copy on your slides. \n\nIt’s good practice to double-check your deck before presenting to catch any mistakes or typos. Here are some common errors to look out for: \n\n* **Spelling or grammar mistakes.** Scanning your deck for incorrect spelling or grammar is more important than you might think. Even a small mistake can make your audience wonder whether there are other flaws in the idea you’re presenting. \n* **Changing punctuation at the end of bullet points.** Decide whether or not you want to punctuate your bullet points — and then stick to your plan. \n* **Inconsistent use of font sizes.** Font sizes for each text style should stay consistent. Headlines need the biggest font size, of course. Then use smaller font sizes for bullet points and supporting copy.\n* **Varying font styles.** Choose just one font style for your headers and another one for your body copy. Avoid using more than two (unless you’re a seasoned graphic designer who can pull it off)!  \n* **Fickle bullet points.** Dots or dashes? Again, pick one — avoid mixing and matching. \n* **Erratic indentation.** Make sure your main and supporting bullet points are aligned correctly so that the flow of information is easy to comprehend.\n\n### 5. Instead of lists, use a grid or cards\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/13a249d8-216d-45bb-9513-0daecd10b1b7\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nTake full advantage of your slide’s canvas with grids or cards instead of listing your text points in a single, boring column. You can try emphasizing each argument with a bigger font and pop of color, or insert images on different cards. Also, if you want to ensure you’re audience is not reading ahead, use (simple) animations to reveal each new point as you speak.\n\nIncorporating visuals in your presentation is an excellent way to help your audience absorb the information you’re sharing. Many decks in the Pitch [template gallery](https://pitch.com/templates) make use of cards, like the [consulting proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Consulting-Proposal-52Nh2S79mYTX4QmmGf08WM1c), [project proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Project-Proposal-22pMbf55jF1o4wddqP6oSJYE), and [Vacanza](https://pitch.com/templates/Vacanza-2qsHLE3mq5YZ4NgMkd5vxDnj) templates**.**\n\n{{component:templates-grid [templates:{\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1663260151/blog/13%20decks%20for%20inclusive%20tech%20culture%20/Consulting_Proposal.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Consulting-Proposal-52Nh2S79mYTX4QmmGf08WM1c\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}, {\"image\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1687792740/presentation-guide/Chapter%203/Vacanza-template.png\",\"url\":\"https://pitch.com/templates/Vacanza-2qsHLE3mq5YZ4NgMkd5vxDnj\",\"ctaLabel\":\"Use this template\"}] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n{{component:button [label:Explore the gallery] [href:https://pitch.com/templates] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIf you want to move cards or blocks around on your slides, try Pitch’s [smart formatting](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3998376-use-smart-formatting) feature, which enables you to easily swap, wrap, and tidy up your content.\n\n### 6.

Instead, spread them across multiple slides. \n\nThis gives your audience the chance to fully grasp each idea, and ample time to digest all the details. Uncluttered slides are easier on the eyes, and your presentation will have a better flow. In short, more is more.\n\n### 7. Make sure your text is legible\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/78344cb7-2956-4ce7-8196-7283f95b856d\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe standard font size rule for presentations is simple: Your fonts should be at least 3**2 pt for headlines** and **24 pt for subtitles.** Keeping these text sizes in mind will ensure that your slides are clear and legible — you don't want your audience, especially the people in the back of the room, squinting to read small fonts."},{"title":"Best ways to leverage fonts in your presentations ","content":"### Use various font weights \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/6cf8ad99-5b3a-417f-9f15-218deaf972cd\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nCombining bold and regular fonts is a popular method of creating contrast that’s often used in graphic design and typography. Two different weights of the same font style can provide a visual hierarchy and draw the eye to important pieces of information.\n\n### Use two fonts \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/21cfd19f-608a-4e4e-ad22-5b2ba88a1465\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAnother way to create contrast in your copy is to combine two different typefaces. When using two fonts, a good rule of thumb is to pair a serif font with a complementary sans-serif font. Avoid putting together fonts that are too similar in style — you want the contrast to be apparent. \n\nDoes your brand have its own font rules? With Pitch, you can [upload custom fonts](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4057308-upload-custom-fonts) to your library and use them for all your presentations. \n\n### Use different font sizes\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/f712387b-09e3-4ba9-a8d0-44daae0522da\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nYou can also highlight a point by using a larger font size. This is especially effective when presenting numerical data or statistics. For instance, if sales have increased by 78%, write the number \"78\" in a large font on your slide. \n\nPitch’s free [modern resume](https://pitch.com/templates/Resume-Modern-6hhg796EvthT5BRWFa3579jC), [marketing proposal](https://pitch.com/templates/Marketing-Proposal-6BazfH6AcfE45PJr5i5oE3qM), and [UX research report](https://pitch.com/templates/UX-Research-Report-2oMWqb6HuYHS5A2pH764Lw5U) presentation templates use this strategy too. \n\n### Use shapes \n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/06b716ff-49d5-4368-8dbb-96e11735d9ec/944cde21-b71c-494f-b021-0a35f9602be5\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nShapes can be an effective way to enhance the visual impact of your message and help your audience better understand the content you're presenting. Circles and squares are great for emphasizing points, organizing information, creating interest, and visualizing concepts — like drawing a circle to show a cycle or a triangle to show hierarchy. \n\nAgain, consistency is crucial. Stick to just a few simple shapes to keep your presentation clear and organized."},{"title":"Get creative when formatting your presentation slides","content":"Placing text onto slides doesn't have to be boring.

It’s also essential to research your audience, understand what they care about, and consider the venue and setting in which they’ll experience your presentation.\n\nHere are the key questions you need to answer.\n\n## What does a winning presentation achieve? \n\nA clear grasp of your presentation's purpose and objectives will guide the structure and content of your deck. \n\nConsider the desired outcome of your presentation. What do you want your audience to take away from it? Are you hoping they'll learn something new, consider trying your product, or be inspired to take action? Or are you hoping to walk out with a firm decision, actionable next steps, or a commitment to buy or invest? And how will you know you’ve achieved your goal?\n\nHaving a defined objective will help you craft a powerful closing to your presentation that reiterates your key messages and moves your audience to take that desired next step. Whether it's to spread the word, make a purchase, or put your advice into practice, make sure the call to action is clear and memorable.\n\n### What’s your key message?\n\nYour message is the heart of your presentation, and it shapes the way you tell your story. When crafting your key message, think about what you want your audience to learn, understand, or feel after you present. This will serve as the foundation for your deck. \n\nOnce you’ve defined your key message, you can start supporting it with data, anecdotes, and other compelling content. For example, including statistics from a credible source to back up your points will lend your presentation credibility and authority. Stories and testimonials will always make your message more relatable and memorable. \n\n[Multiple studies](https://www.inc.com/james-sudakow/why-a-good-story-is-far-more-persuasive-than-facts.html) have shown that human stories are more persuasive than data alone. Mixing the two will help convince both hearts and heads.\n\n### Who are you presenting to?\n\nWhen preparing your presentation, it's important to know who your audience is, how well they understand the topic, and what their attitude is toward your desired outcome. Are they new to the subject, or do they already have extensive knowledge of it? What are their needs and challenges?\n\nThink about how you can reference relatable experiences so that your audience feels understood. For instance, if you're presenting to a group of beginners, you'll want to start with the basics and provide clear visual aids and examples. If you’re presenting to experts, first demonstrate your own expertise on the subject matter to win them over and show them that you have something new to offer.\n\n### Where will you present?\n\nThe last thing to consider is the venue and setting in which you’ll present. This is more than just the location; the environment and atmosphere in which people will experience your presentation are also key. \n\nWill you be in a small conference room, a large auditorium, or an outdoor venue? How many people will you be speaking to? Will you present in-person or on a video call? Or maybe you’re not presenting live at all, and instead sending out your presentation for the audience to read in their own time.\n\nYou should also consider the technical setup and amount of time you’ll have to present. Will you have a Q\u0026A session afterward? How can you drive audience participation? Will your audience get access to your slides or handouts before or after the meeting or talk?\n\nPaying attention to these details will help you tailor your presentation to the audience and their mindset."},{"title":"3 steps to building your presentation storyline","content":"If you want your audience to stay engaged, you need to structure your ideas as a well-crafted story.

Create an outline\n\nUse a storytelling framework that translates your key message into a compelling narrative. This framework doesn't have to be complex — it just needs to be cohesive and well organized. \n\nHere are two popular storytelling frameworks to consider.\n\n#### Framework 1: SCQA\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/2662fba8-62c9-4b36-a9cb-c9d937fbcd71/6f7d4e3c-4fa2-4362-9d09-f6b6930665c5\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe [SCQA framework](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career/scqa/) helps you guide your audience through four logical steps: \n\n* First, introduce the situation and provide the necessary context. \n* Next, dive into the complication. Highlight the problem or opportunity at hand, and explain why it's important to address it immediately.\n* Then, ask your audience a core question.\n* Finally, wrap up by answering the question. Support your solution with relevant data, research, or testimonials.\n\nThis approach enables you to close your presentation with a strong call to action. \n\n#### **Framework 2: The hero’s journey**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/2662fba8-62c9-4b36-a9cb-c9d937fbcd71/d4a200d5-a5b6-4560-a211-b2c515815e3b\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe [hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) is an influential storytelling framework developed by Joseph Campbell in 1949 and adapted by Christopher Vogler for the modern era in 2007. It’s traditionally used to structure epic stories, but it can be applied to any type of storytelling.\n\nIn your presentation, the audience takes on the role of the hero, and you, the presenter, guide them through an adventure, a crisis, and a transformation. This journey is typically divided into twelve stages which can be grouped into three acts:\n\n* **Act 1 — The ordinary world:** The audience doesn’t realize there’s a problem, and you introduce an idea to increase their awareness of the situation. At first, they’ll likely be skeptical of change.\n* **Act 2 — The special world:** The second act is all about the confrontation. As a presenter, you share your experience, insights, and tools to assist the audience on their journey and help them further explore the new idea.\n* **Act 3 — Return to the ordinary world:** This is the resolution, in which the audience returns from their journey renewed by everything they’ve learned. They’re equipped with new tools and insights, ready to improve and move forward.\n\nThe hero's journey is a powerful storytelling method in presentations because it allows the audience to feel like they’re actively participating in the experience. It keeps them engaged and makes it more likely that they’ll remember the key takeaways.\n\n#### Writing your outline\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/2662fba8-62c9-4b36-a9cb-c9d937fbcd71/4b8f09c7-7c6e-4032-beaf-8290e6e222fd\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nOnce you’ve decided on a storytelling framework, you can write your outline. An effective way of organizing your story is through a simple dot-dash structure. Dots represent the main ideas that drive your storyline, and dashes represent all the supporting content: your arguments, facts, and data. \n\nIt can be easier to jot down your outline in a text format first before you start creating slides. But if you prefer to work on your slides directly, write out your headlines (the dots), then drop text notes on each blank slide listing your supporting materials (the dashes) — which we’ll dive into next.\n\n### **2. Gather your supporting materials**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/2662fba8-62c9-4b36-a9cb-c9d937fbcd71/221e654b-e297-49e6-b3ae-5fde2a8a3f1f\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nIt’s time to collect all the proof points that’ll lend your story character and confidence — the dashes from your outline. Gather together any research, data, calculations, quotes, case studies, testimonials, or anecdotes you feel will support your message. \n\nThis is where your story really starts coming alive. As you begin to combine your written outline and supporting materials into draft slides, you’ll notice your narrative taking shape. You’ll be able to see which arguments are well supported, and where you might need to dig a little deeper to strengthen an idea.\n\n### **3. Use structural elements to guide your audience**\n\n{{component:pitch-embed [code:\u003ciframe src=\"https://pitch.com/embed/2662fba8-62c9-4b36-a9cb-c9d937fbcd71/6ee1a898-24b8-448c-86fa-e8181dc6f5ae\" allow=\"fullscreen\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e] [caption:] [layout:normal] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nStructural elements in a presentation can help your audience situate themselves, like a map with a “You are here” arrow. Using these elements keeps your deck clean, cohesive, and easy to follow.\n\nHere are a few key slides and slide elements that’ll help guide your audience: \n\n* Include an **agenda slide** at the very beginning of your deck, with a list of the topics you’ll be sharing. This gives your audience an overview of what to expect.\n* Make use of **section dividers** to separate the different parts of your deck. These also make for refreshing pauses throughout your audience’s journey. \n* Well-structured decks typically include **trackers** — visual elements that show an audience how far through a section they are, or where on the story map they’re currently located. These are usually placed at the side or in the corner of your slides, and can also act as a fun branding element. Check out these presentation [templates](https://pitch.com/templates) that have trackers, including the [conference talk](https://pitch.com/templates/Conference-Talk-0sLGgd3eVqCs4uBksm0T2vex?details-modal=gallery-modal\u0026username=gilhuybrecht) and [remote learning lesson plan](https://pitch.com/templates/Remote-Learning-Lesson-Plan-3hthr54yaBiY4JxP6y3h3Jqh?details-modal=gallery-modal\u0026username=pitch) templates."},{"title":"Tools to structure your presentation ","content":"Structuring your presentation for success doesn't have to be complicated.

The most effective sales presentations today are on brand and enable sales professionals to focus on creating a great buyer experience with every call and smooth follow-up.\n\n## Create a presentation to fit your format\n\nIn the age of remote pitching, make sure your teams not only have material for every stage of the buyer journey, but a deck for each type of presentation format. Below, we outline the three formats to tailor your sales presentation to:\n\n* In-person presentations\n* Remote sales presentations\n* [Pre-recorded presentation](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) \n\nWhile traditional sales has valued in-person meetings, many pitches today can happen remotely. With the tools available today, pre-recorded presentations also make it easy for sales teams to distribute sales pitches in a scalable way, while offering buyers flexibility in how they engage with the information. We’ll outline the benefits of each before focusing on how remote and pre-recorded presentations can build scalable sales processes.\n\n### In-person presentations\n\nThe biggest advantage to pitching in person is how much easier it is to transmit your enthusiasm. You can react to your audience’s body language and generally read the room.  \n\nPeople also tend to be more engaged in person, so you have more wiggle room to stretch your presentation. You might go into details or spend more time on anecdotes. You can also use time prior to the formal pitch to have a more personal conversation or flip through materials together after the meeting has formally ended. Organic interactions can help you learn about your buyer and build trust. \n\nHowever, in-person presentations are costly: They require travel time, expenses, and more resources put into planning and scheduling. \n\n### Remote sales presentations\n\nRemote sales presentations have become a staple of the sales process. They’re easy to set up and attend within a focused time frame. This allows reps to focus on addressing the buyer’s key concerns and delivering your company’s value proposition.\n\nEven with this focused format, the best sales professionals will find a way to leave an impression. Virtual sales presentation technique focuses on staying succinct, a clean delivery, and a seamless call experience. Check your tech in advance and set a professional call environment. Jordan Goodwin, [Remote’s](https://remote.com/) Director of Sales for North America, also recommends blurring your Zoom background and getting rid of the dock on your screen to create a “clean, customer-friendly experience.”\n\n### Pre-recorded presentations\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654782521/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-playback-in-slide-deck.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654780720/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-playback-in-slide-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:This video is on a slide that states \"The Problem\". The video zooms into a bubble at the bottom left corner of the slide and a white woman with curly hair begins talking. The video zooms back out and goes to the next slide, where a white woman with her hair tied up talks from the bottom right corner of the slide. In the next slide, a white man with a mustache speaks from the left-hand side. The next one has a black man speak from a similar position. Then, it returns to the first woman with curly hair.] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAdding pre-recorded to your slides helps you bring personality and context to your deck. You can record once and share multiple times. Busy prospects can watch – and rewatch – a sales pitch on their own time. Better yet, they can share it with their stakeholders without requiring another introductory call. \n\nHaving [recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) in your decks makes follow-up less routine and more human with an expressive way to communicate your ideas.\n\nNow that we’ve covered your format options, let’s look at some techniques to help you seal the deal.\n\n## Sales presentation techniques for any format\n\nGone are the days of watching the clock in a meeting room. A study quoted in the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2022/03/dear-manager-youre-holding-too-many-meetings) found that the average number of meetings that workers attended increased by 13.5% during the pandemic. Thanks to streamlined communication tools that help us stay connected in person and online, meetings today are more efficient than ever. That's why it's important to build a cutting-edge pitch deck that offers value for your prospects and makes the most of their time."},{"content":"Once your team has a sales presentation template for each stage of the sales cycle, they can focus on presentation delivery. This may be part of formalized onboarding or ongoing training to ensure that a growing sales team continues to deliver top results. Let’s go over the best practices of presentation delivery to cover with your sales team.\n\n### 1. Communicate clearly and simply\n\n[Studies](https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apps.12360?campaign=wolearlyview) performed during the pandemic suggest that “Zoom fatigue” cuts down on our ability to focus in remote meetings. \n\nClean slides with crisp, memorable lines help your sales reps with their choice of words. This is where you can support your AEs by working with marketing and branding teams to create a library of templates for key sales calls, like a discovery deck, [product overview deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Simple-Sales-Deck-7TPRBe4bud9z576qVR3RQpVE), [demo deck](https://pitch.com/templates/Product-Demo-6gXTPr2hMAM34ojxLE5vPKDg), and more.\n\nPeople are less likely to interject with a question during a video call, so it’s important to make the presentation easy to understand and offer dedicated moments for audience engagement. Adding section slides helps your AE build clear pauses into their presentations to engage their audience.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nI find that having slides can make concepts more tangible. Having visuals to pair with auditory information helps a buyer to remember and digest the information.] [cta-label:Jordan Goodwin] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/remote-jordan-goodwin.jpg] [name:Jordan Goodwin] [role:Director of Sales, North America] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485412/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_remote.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 2. Establish a voice\n\n   The right tone communicates confidence to put buyers at ease, so it’s important to find a voice that feels natural. \n\n   When sales collateral is developed as a team, account executives can learn from each other and develop a compelling deck that everyone can take off the shelf to make their own: Remove a slide here, add a prospect’s logo there, and they’re ready to present a familiar pitch with a fresh perspective.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nI always try to come in with a point of view. I make sure that I know about the industry, the company, and person to make our call more of a conversation, instead of just talking at them or asking questions.] [cta-label:Jordan Goodwin] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/remote-jordan-goodwin.jpg] [name:Jordan Goodwin] [role:Director of Sales, North America] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485412/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_remote.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nKeep in mind that establishing a voice does not require the presenter to do all the talking. In fact, the best sales calls are conversations where the target audience feels heard. When a presenter finds a natural voice, they will also be more relaxed and receptive. Listening is just as essential to a call after the presentation part is over.\n\n### 3. Practice delivery\n\nThere’s only one chance for a first impression, so it’s essential for sales reps to know how they come across. Get your team to practice in front of a mirror, record themselves, or have live practice sessions to make sure key points are covered. Get presenters to pay attention to these factors:\n\n* Speed: slowing down to enunciate and make ideas easier to follow\n* Timing: staying within an allotted time to not bore the audience\n* Pacing: pausing to emphasize key points and allow for interactions\n\nBetter yet, encourage them to join presentation organizations such as [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) to get comfortable with delivering a polished message. In some cases, encourage them to start by writing out a script and practicing word for word, as they would a keynote. Of course, once they are confident in presenting the buyer’s story, company’s messaging, and potential solution, they can improvise and treat the call as a conversation.\n\n### 4. Involve your team\n\nSales teams can work together to practice and refine presentations. Some arrangements have a few leads work on refreshing a main sales deck every quarter, while others do a workshop session with the entire team. \n\nCompanies that onboard new hires in cohorts can also do group sales training. This helps new joiners ramp up and share learnings.\n\nAlso, look for collaboration opportunities and regularly getet feedback from the marketing team on messaging and delivery. Keeping a tight relationship with marketing efforts helps your AEs match their messaging for a prospect and use the latest assets. Having regular check-ins with the product team also gives you roadmap features to sell to both new and existing customers\n\n### 5. Listen to the data\n\n{{component:video [sources:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/video/upload/v1654780738/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-recordings-embedded-in-slide-deck.mp4] [poster:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1654780722/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-video-recordings-embedded-in-slide-deck.png] [caption:] [loop:true] [layout:normal] [transcript:A screenshot of how to create an embedded video recording in a slide deck. In the video, you see the cursor navigate to the top right corner and click the \"Record\" button. After this, a grey video bubble popps up in the bottom left corner of the slide. The cursor drags the video bubble up to the top right hand corner of the slide, then clicks \"Add recording\". A pop-up window shows the same slide, with a red button a the bottom that says \"Start Recording\". The video bubble is now replaced with the camera's view of a white woman's head. She begins talking to record her clip. She is also able to record video clips in the three boxes in the slide.] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe target audience is the judge of a good presentation. A presenter who is familiar with the material and confident in their pitch has the mental space to observe the audience. How are they responding to product features? Do they have follow-up questions? What is their body language suggesting? In the end, a successful call depends on active listening. \n\nHowever, sales teams also need to be informed by data, not just gut feelings. Using modern tools like Pitch enables sales teams to see how many people have viewed a sales deck to assess engagement. For example, Pitch Pro users can [create custom links and review presentation analytics](https://pitch.com/whats-new/introducing-presentation-analytics) to get a sense of whether buyers have reviewed or shared a deck after a call. This type of data can help you find out key information such as which slide templates are most effective, or which AEs engage their audiences best.\n\n## Presenting as a team\n\nThe most effective sales presentation begins with thorough preparation and ends with swift, professional follow-up. \n\nBy now, you have built a supportive culture in your sales team through collaborating on slide decks, sharing resources, and learning together. At this point, it’s up to the AE to deliver their presentation. But their individual success is backed by a strong team effort. To ensure sales excellence, make sure your AEs are prepared before, during, and after their call.\n\n### Before the call\n\nMost sales presentations begin before the actual call. You can already start a conversation by sharing a prepared sales deck – possibly through a [voice recorder](https://www.veed.io/tools/voice-recorder) or [video recordings](https://pitch.com/blog/introducing-recordings) – with a buyer and invite them to leave [comments](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments) on specific slides. These pre-call exchanges build trust and give the team data points on how to tailor the presentation for the actual call. \n\nIf there is additional material that can strengthen a pitch, encourage AEs to [collaborate](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318672-collaborate-with-comments) with other teams to get the relevant information. With Pitch, you can [assign specific slides](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) to individuals so that people can hop in quickly to add the specific charts, data, or images that will make a buyer feel catered to.\n\nYou’re halfway to a winning presentation with a primed audience and prepared materials. The other half is making sure everyone on your team covers the basics of a video call: \n\n* Sign in early\n* Have good lighting \n* Make sure your background is professional or blurred\n* Ensure WiFi, audio, and video equipment are set up\n\nWhen your sales team maintains a level of professionalism and preparedness before a call, they can remain relaxed and ready to genuinely engage a buyer.\n\n### During the call\n\nIf your team has built a solid deck together, done the necessary practice, and completed technical checks, the call should flow naturally. During a call, your sales team should make sure the buyer feels their concerns are heard. By the end of the conversation, the audience should be clear on next steps. A good presentation shows that the team has done their homework and is invested in being a good partner.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nUse assumptive language. Present the research you’ve done to address the prospect’s issue. Recommend to them how your product or service provides a means to their stated goal.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/remote-jordan-goodwin.jpg] [name:Jordan Goodwin] [role:Director of Sales, North America] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485412/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_remote.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nMany sales teams have a practice of having a colleague shadow sales calls to give the presenter feedback, especially for sales training. Set up your team for success by supporting them through their early calls, or having them shadow a senior AE to pick up the nuances between audience education and hard selling. \n\nMake sure that even your AEs who consistently exceed their quotas keep a collaborative mindset. For example, inviting the relevant colleagues from product or engineering for a call with a bigger client can help clarify technical questions and shorten the sales cycle. Colleagues that take calls together provide support with the relevant data, step in during technical issues, or shift the flow of a conversation. Find a way to reward AEs who deliver value by sharing best practices and investing in processes that elevate the whole team’s performance. \n\n### After the call\n\nA good sales presentation becomes great with the perfect follow-up. Send answers to open questions and additional resources right after a call to keep sales momentum.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nThe most important part of the follow-up happens during the call.

Jordan has years of experience in enterprise sales with leading companies such as Gitlab and he agreed to sit down and share some of his sales presentation tips.   \n\n### How do you measure the success of a sales presentation? \n\n**[Jordan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/remotejordan/):** There are some specific metrics we look at, like win rates and sales deal velocity. We also look at land size versus expansion and the time between the initial land deal and the expansion. But at a high level, the most important question is: “Does our sales rep understand what problem the customer is trying to solve? Were they able to answer the questions that got the customer on the phone with us today in the first place?”\n\n### What might be common sales objections and how do your teams address them in a call?\n\n**Jordan:** A common one for is price, because we have a flat fee model. If a company is looking to hire someone on a very low salary, our service fee might be too big of a percent of that individual salary for Remote to make sense as a solution. Sometimes we can come up with a price point that works for everyone, but there are times when it’s really not in line with our value proposition. If that’s the case, we will tell them that we aren’t the best fit based on their goals and challenges and we want to respect their time. Disqualifying a lead is just as important as qualifying one.\n\n### What tips do you have specific for remote or video presentations?\n\n**Jordan:** For one, follow best practices for being on a webcam: Blur your background, or make sure you have a professional setup behind you. I always encourage people to get rid of the dock on their screen, and make sure they don’t have any notifications coming up to make it a clean, customer-friendly experience.\n\nAnd another big one is building up your expertise and having the right resources available. Having a pitch deck at hand to help illustrate some of the concepts you’re talking about, and then having some specific resources you can show them, such as help pages.\n\n### Can you walk us through a typical sales presentation?\n\n**Jordan:** A typical agenda would start with introductions, and then we would talk about their goals for hiring prospects. After that, we would look at how Remote might partner with them. I like to finish with a Q\u0026A. Some of the typical slides we would use for that explain the difference between a contractor and a Remote employee, or how we can help them with payroll in different countries. We swap in the right slides depending on the problem they’re trying to solve.\n\n### What are immediate follow-up items that keep momentum after the call?\n\n**Jordan:** At the end of the call, we’ll confirm the next step and get the ball rolling, whether it’s sending an invite or at least agreeing on when that invite is going to come. They can also be coached to go and sign up for the platform, and that becomes the next step. They can sign up during the call and look around later, with no commitment.\n\n{{component:button [label:Try Pitch now] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"}],"newsletter-signup-banner":[],"excerpt":"","slug":"/guides/sales/how-to-present","content":""},{"type":"guide-chapter","custom-slug":"sales-presentation-structure","indexed?":true,"chapter-index":1,"guide":"guides/sales","title":"How to structure the perfect sales presentation","intro":"A successful sales presentation turns a potential customer into a buyer.

Doing the research about your ideal customers and using available data from your product or existing users will help you focus on the value proposition and key points. \n\n### Learn about your buyer\n\nWhat and how you should learn about your buyers depends on when sales gets involved in the buyer journey. The exact content of your sales presentation will change depending on whether your sales team is doing discovery calls or reaching out to product qualified leads (PQLs). But the nature of the story will stay the same. \n\nHere are some ways to learn about your buyers:\n\n* Look at where or how they entered your sales funnel\n* Monitor how they’ve previously engaged with the product\n* Perform user interviews with existing customers\n* Find out details during a discovery call\n\nAsk yourself another critical question before diving into your sales presentation: Are you dealing with a lead, a prospect, or a buyer? While teams should nurture leads and prospects, a buyer is where your sales team should focus their energy. A buyer should satisfy three requirements:\n\n1. Have a problem they want to fix\n2. Be willing to change\n3. Clearly understand the impact of making (or failing to make) the change\n\nOnce your team has qualified the buyer intent and understands what the buyer wants, they can build a tailored sales deck. \n\nNot all first calls need to be discovery calls. Many businesses today have product-led growth strategies that allow users to trial a product or use a freemium version. And with businesses that don’t offer these services, prospects may have already visited app review or comparison sites. Sales teams today are dealing with buyers that are better informed and more sophisticated than ever before. As a result, your sales presentations need to offer new knowledge to truly add value. \n\nThe best sales presentations present the story of a buyer in the midst of trying to figure out the solution to their problem. You’ll know your sales team has gotten it right when a prospect or buyer starts parroting back the information that’s being presented — it’s a sign that they see themselves in the story. \n\n### Assign account executives their homework\n\nToday, a successful account executive needs to wear several hats to deliver a successful sales presentation. They need to think beyond selling and act as customer success and onboarding support to build customer relationships.\n\nTo do this, AEs need to understand the product. To thrive in today’s environment, sales teams need to collaborate — with product, marketing, customer success, and even engineering. The more AEs understand a product and empathize with customers’ pain points, the better they can anticipate what buyers will ask.\n\nTo build a successful and scalable sales process, your sales teams need to develop more than just presentation skills. They need to do regular homework to understand customer needs as well as the value the product brings.\n\nNow that you’ve gathered information and done your research, it’s time for the fun part: building your sales deck."},{"title":"Essential elements to include in a sales presentation","content":"Your [sales presentation](https://pitch.com/blog/sales-presentation-tips) should reflect your audience’s unique position in their hero’s journey.

Crossing the threshold\n5. Unveiling the path to success\n\n{{component:button [label:View Chapter 1] [href:https://pitch.com/guides/sales/sales-presentation-ideas] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe narrative stages mentioned above bring a checklist of slides to life with a story. Every sales presentation needs slides about product features and client testimonials. Presenting them in a natural way that centers on the audience will make them feel relevant. With these slides as an outline, sales professionals can take a buyer on a journey that builds an emotional connection with your product and brand.\n\nSo how do the storytelling tactics translate into a sales presentation outline that can deliver repeated success? That’s what we’re about to find out!\n\n## How to structure a sales presentation\n\nStructure and pacing distinguish average sales pitches from a great sales presentation. Pay attention to how much time you spend on each section, as well as to the way you transition from one section to the next. Every presentation has its basic ingredients — but how they come together should never feel formulaic.\n\nIn this section, we’ll break down how to structure your sales presentation and choose the key points that will catch your audience’s attention and deliver your product’s value proposition. \n\n### Step 1: Introduce your prospect's pain points\n\nBe respectful of your prospect’s time by cutting straight to what matters most: the pain points they want to solve. Use this problem to frame the rest of your sales presentation.\n\nYour first slides should succinctly outline your buyer’s most pressing pain points. This is where your company’s research — on both an ideal customer persona (ICP) and your prospect — should be used. Mapping your prospect to a specific ICP focuses the type of sales presentation you’ll create. Your information on the prospect might come from your own research. It could also come from product usage data, like inviting a team member into their workspace. \n\nUse whatever data you can gather to tailor your delivery. As you assemble your slides, think about what visual aids best support the problem statement. For some products, it might be a photo, while others may require diagrams to visualize a relationship to the audience. \n\nBe concise in this section. It leads into what really matters: the impact of the problem.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nEven people who are aware of your product are just leads or prospects if there's no buying intent.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### Step 2: Describe the problem’s impact \n\nOnce you’ve highlighted a preestablished problem, it’s time to hone in on the impact that problem has on your buyer’s work and business. This is where you can use assumptive language to provoke a response.\n\nYou’ll need to frame the impact in a way that makes sense to your buyer and their unique position within the company. For instance, their current way of doing things could be negatively impacting time, human resources, or funds. \n\nThere is no fixed way to visualize this in your sales deck. The most effective approach is one that fits the type of audience you’re speaking to — and your AE’s pitch style. But it usually requires a balance between numbers and relatability. Numbers, such as hours lost weekly, make the human story concrete. This is the impact that’ll likely drive your prospect to look for a solution. These numbers lead to a polarizing statement that highlights the problem’s inflation if it’s not addressed now.  \n\nThis section of your presentation is crucial for establishing rapport with your audience. While the best-case scenario is body-language agreement like nodding, disagreement isn’t necessarily a problem. Using assumptive language or a provocative statement engages the audience and helps you separate a lead or prospect from a buyer. If they agree, can they tell you more? If they disagree, can they share why? If your audience engages with an opinion, they likely intend to change their current status. And voilà, you have a potential buyer!\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nThe key difference between a lead or prospect and an actual buyer is intent: a willingness to change, a clear problem they want to fix, and an idea of a solution’s impact.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe exchange will lead your prospect to engage with the next part of your sales presentation: an explanation of why change isn’t just possible — it’s urgently necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Why change now?\n\nUrgency and momentum drive deals. But great sales presentations aren’t about forcing prospects to buy blindly. They help prospects understand the impact of change and navigate the path to success.\n\nThis part of the sales pitch pivots from pain points to alternatives on the horizon. Successful presentations transform this section into a critical fork in the road that requires the potential customer to act now. Without being too heavy-handed, clearly show the audience what they stand to lose — especially against competitor companies — by not acting. \n\n### Step 4: Present the solution\n\nWith the stakes raised, your audience needs a solution: a clear path toward their goal. An effective sales presentation presents your product as a means to the prospect’s end. This section isn’t about showcasing every feature or selling all the propositions of your product. Instead, embed your product as an aid in your prospect’s journey. Remember, your prospect is the hero who’s about to embark on a quest to save their company — so make that clear in your presentation.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nTell your prospect, ‘We think the right answer to this equation is this. Let me show you how.’] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nThe strategy here is simple: present the right answer to your prospect’s problem! In other words, show your prospect how they can implement your product, and which product features solve their specific needs. Don’t dwell on all your product benefits. Instead, keep up your storytelling momentum by describing the impact on your prospect’s company. What improvements should they notice in their path toward the promised land? What results will indicate they’ve arrived?\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nKeep a pulse on your audience’s response to your proposal. Ask them whether it could be the right answer to the solution they’re after.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nAs you present the solution, take note of your audience’s attention. If it’s an in-person meeting, maintain eye contact and read their reactions. Your sales pitch is designed to help your prospect see their path to success — but check in to see whether they agree. Remember, agreement is ideal, but engagement is crucial. \n\n### Step 5: Address reservations and FAQs\n\nAn engaged buyer is sure to have questions. However, your sales deck and presentation should address the basic considerations so that you can focus your energy on buyer objections. \n\nAfter you’ve presented your buyer a clear path toward success, you need to provide evidence. This is where you include:\n\n* Social proof and major clients\n* Client testimonials\n* Data on business impact\n\nWhile it may be tempting to cover all your bases, stay succinct with your slide deck so you can spend more time on the conversation. If experience and data show that you need additional supporting materials, you can add slides to an Appendix or FAQs section to reference only when asked. Common slides for an Appendix may include:\n\n* Advantages over competitors\n* Case studies\n* Pricing structure\n\nIf you’ve developed your sales deck in Pitch, you can send your prospect a private or [custom link](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/6046701-create-custom-links-to-your-presentations) and add additional slides after your pitch. That way, your prospect can check the slides whenever it’s convenient. By [sharing your sales deck](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/3748926-share-a-presentation-with-others), you give your prospect and their stakeholders a convenient way to [view, forward, and comment](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5335224-view-presentations) on the slides. If you’re using Pitch Pro, you can use [presentation analytics](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/5592127-view-presentation-analytics) to see how often a prospect has opened your sales deck to gauge interest and engagement.\n\nTo efficiently build sales decks, you can create a sales presentation template complete with the latest FAQs and case studies. This’ll allow you to quickly duplicate a deck and prepare a dedicated sales presentation for each new prospect in minutes.\n\n## Building and upgrading your presentation \n\nAfter you’ve built your presentation outline and filled in the initial contents, it’s time to give your deck a final polish. To accurately represent your brand, sales teams need to involve experts from other departments. Have your product teams check that feature descriptions are current. Have your brand team ensure assets are updated, and ask designers to make sure everything is pixel-perfect. With Pitch, you can easily do this by [assigning slides to colleagues](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide). They can [set the status of their slide as done](https://help.pitch.com/en/articles/4318642-set-a-status-and-assignees-for-a-slide) once they’ve finished."},{"title":"Customizable, ready-to-use sales presentations","content":"Are you interested in using Pitch to create decks that convert?

The crossover point is consideration — when someone starts considering options and looking to see what's available. That's the beginning of their buyer’s journey.\n\nIn your call with your buyer, you want to understand if they have buying intent. Have they understood the problem and the impact it has? And, critically, are they willing to change? \n\nOne of the ways to figure this out is to make a polarizing statement that gets a yes-no response. If it’s yes, that’s great! If it’s no, invite your prospect to tell you more. You want to engage with your audience. If they care, they’ll respond.\n\n### How do you emotionally connect with a buyer and keep them engaged throughout a presentation? \n\n**Belal:** When you’re delivering your sales pitch, present some sort of limbic brain messaging to trigger an emotional response. Say something provocative, and get them engaged.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that people respond to negative scenarios. As a buyer, I may not agree with your assessment of how to make me the first or best, but I definitely know I want to avoid being the last. \n\n### Can you walk us through a sales deck flow that puts a prospect at the center?\n\n**Belal:** Your slides should focus on nailing the problem statement. How companies do that can vary, but here’s one blueprint for your deck:\n\nSlide 1: Start with an optional credibility slide.\n\nSlide 2: Relate to your audience and say, “I know people like you. You constantly have this particular problem.”\n\nSlide 3: Show the current status and say, “You do this with these tools, and this is the undesirable outcome.”\n\nSlide 4: Here’s something different.\n\nSlides 5–10: Tell the story of the buyer’s quest for success so that they understand the jobs to be done and what needs to happen. \n\n### What should an MVP sales deck answer for a prospect?\n\n**Belal:** People have different views on how to build sales decks. I build them visually so that AEs can focus on the storytelling. Your sales deck helps you do three things to engage your audience: state the problem, outline the impact of the problem, and deliver your proposed solution.  \n\nIf your buyer is interested, they’ll probably loop in someone else — and that person will start the buyer journey all over again. Your sales presentation needs to summarize the relevance of what you talked about in earlier meetings, and move along to what’s relevant for everyone in the room.\n\nTo do that, illustrate how the first person helped you (the AE) understand that problem as well as the impact of that problem. You can admit you don’t know the second person’s willingness to change it — but you know their problem and the impact of fixing it. Ideally, your sales deck will lead into an engaged conversation.  \n\n### How many slides should a sales deck have? \n\n**Belal:** When you make a really great deck that’s highly relevant to the person you're presenting to, the number of slides doesn't matter. In other words, if 80–90% of the deck is about me, you can make it a 30-slide deck. If it's about your company and your product, then it better be the fewest slides possible because the audience won’t care!\n\n{{component:button [label:Try Pitch now] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}","title":"Interview: Belal Batrawy from GTM Buddy"}],"newsletter-signup-banner":[],"excerpt":"","slug":"/guides/sales/sales-presentation-structure","content":""},{"type":"guide-chapter","custom-slug":"sales-presentation-ideas","indexed?":true,"chapter-index":0,"guide":"guides/sales","title":"How to find ideas worth selling","intro":"","meta-image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1650467616/sales-guide/pitch-sales-guide-Social_share.png","meta-description":"Find out how to deliver sales presentations that meet buyer expectations today.

Start with the why\n\nBefore you build your slides, you need to be clear on the *why* for the person you’re selling to. Why does your prospect have a problem, and how does it impact their work or business? Why are they talking to you now?\n\nPart of the why may be answered by how prospects come into your sales funnel. For example, is your team picking up marketing qualified leads (MQLs) based on a pricing page visit or guide download? Their interaction is a first indication of their top-of-mind considerations. \n\nYou may also get insights about the customer profile from other departments, such as user research or lifecycle marketing. An effective sales pitch must be informed by learning — not assuming — why a prospect is looking for solutions.\n\n### 2. Map your buyer’s journey\n\nNext, you need to identify where your prospect is in the buyer journey. Are they at the awareness, consideration, or decision stage? Sales teams often engage a prospect or lead at these stages:\n\n* **Discovery:** When an AE actively reaches out to a prospect to learn about their needs\n* **Book a demo:** When a prospect actively reaches out to an AE to find out more about the product\n* **Activated user:** When an AE’s role is to build contract value from an existing user or account\n\nThe best sales teams help a prospect along their journey. A [Harvard Business Review study](https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-new-sales-imperative) found that suppliers who make buying easy are 62% more likely than others to win a high-quality sale (when a customer pays for a premium offering). This means that sales professionals need to think beyond deal size and factor in both customer experience and customer success.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nEverything that you do to make your presentation more polished, more structured and organized, gives your audience a feel for what your company can deliver in a partnership.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235867/sales-guide/codility-Megan-Loveridge.jpg] [name:Megan Loveridge] [role:Vice President of Global Sales] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485420/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_codility.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\nWhen your sales team is clear on how their first interaction with a prospect fits in the whole buyer journey, they can tailor their sales presentations accordingly. Now, it's time to figure out who to focus on.\n\n### 3. Segment your buyers from your leads \n\nDistinguishing between cooler leads and immediate prospective buyers will convert wasted calls into fruitful meetings. Identifying who is ready, willing, and able to pay for a solution is key to building an effective, scalable, and replicable sales process. At a basic level, you need to distinguish between these two types of prospects: \n\n* **Lead:** Fits the ideal customer profile (ICP), but there is no obvious intent to buy\n* **Prospective buyer:** Knows they have a problem, wants to solve it, and is willing to pay for a solution\n\nSome sales teams may qualify a prospect during a discovery call. Others may instead wait for a trigger event, such as a user inviting a team member. Once your team can confidently identify prospective buyers, you can create relevant sales pitches that speak to those customer profiles. Next, it’s time to think through how to develop your buyer story.\n\n{{component:testimonial [text:\n\nThe big difference between a lead or prospect and an actual buyer is intent — a willingness to change, a clear problem you want to fix, and some idea of the impact fixing that problem will lead to.] [cta-label:] [cta-href:] [photo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651235869/sales-guide/belal-batrawy.jpg] [name:Belal Batrawy] [role:Head of GTM] [company-logo:https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1651485421/sales-guide/Guide-testimpnial-logos_GTMbuddy.png] [layout:] [variant:] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}\n\n### 4. Find your buyer story\n\nThe difference between a mediocre and great sales pitch is relevance. According to a [Harvard Business School study](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-subconscious-mind-of-the-consumer-and-how-to-reach-it), 95% of purchasing decisions take place in the subconscious mind, meaning they’re driven by feelings, not rational decisions. By the end of your sales presentation, does your prospect feel heard? By presenting a buyer's story that resonates, sales teams build trust with prospects.\n\nWe’ll outline some ways you can understand your buyers better in the next section of this chapter. After you’ve understood where your prospects are coming from, the next step is to drill down on their pain points and how they can be solved.\n\n### 5. Identify customer pain points and resolutions\n\nAn effective sales presentation builds a narrative around a prospect’s pain point. It’s what drives them on this quest for a solution — turns them into a protagonist. \n\nYour buyer has a job-to-be-done. Their resolution is getting that job done. A great sales presentation identifies the quest and what success looks like. \n\nIdeally, the paid version of your product or feature helps a prospect get to where they need to go. But don’t force-fit a solution. A compelling pitch uses an authentic story about how a prospect can achieve success with the tools you’re offering.\n\nBefore diving into building your deck, let's look at some ways you can understand your buyers better.\n\n## Understanding your buyers better: looking internally\n\nSome of the best sales presentation ideas come from people outside of sales. Successful sales teams today are effectively embedded in and aligned with a wider organization. This section shows how other departments in your company can provide presentation ideas and supporting material for the whole sales cycle.\n\n### Customer experience\n\nCustomer experience teams always have an ear to the ground. They can provide valuable qualitative customer insights, such as favorite features or common frustrations.\n\n### Product\n\nProduct teams can provide sales with new features to sell and the background on why the product was developed the way it was.\n\n### Marketing\n\nMarketing and sales should work closely together to tighten the sales cycle and attract better leads. Since marketers work on language, tone, and personas, they’re poised to help sales craft a consistent message that stays on-brand. Marketers can also develop or co-develop sales materials.\n\n### Leadership\n\nCompany leadership is usually immersed in the company’s vision. Borrowing their language and positioning can help your sales team align sales deck materials. \n\n### Revenue\n\nYour revenue team may also be a source of insights. They can tell you whether any customers have made a self-serve upgrade or how payments are processed.\n\nReaching out to internal teams can provide you with game-changing data and yield inspired sales presentation ideas. Use the information as the basis for your product storytelling, and you’ll be on your way to a winning sales presentation.\n\n## How to understand your buyers better: looking externally\n\nDon't be shy about getting inspiration from existing customers. After all, they're the ones using and paying for your product all the time — they know it best! They’ve already lived the success story you want to share with prospects, and they hold the raw material you can use to build a story that sells.\n\nIdentify where you can reach customers. To do this, leverage user research, marketing, and customer success teams. Here are a few ways to get started.\n\n### Pulse surveys \n\nQuick questions help validate a hypothesis on customer sentiment around your overall product, new feature, or particular interaction. This provides your sales decks with data.\n\n### Open-ended surveys \n\nOpen-ended surveys are more qualitative, but they can provide details that help give your story a human touch. For example, you might get a testimonial or extract common words that happy customers use to describe their product experience.\n\n### Email\n\nEmail is another survey distribution channel. Try running an NPS survey with an option for customers to share more feedback.\n\n### Focus groups \n\nGet customers on a video call, or even meet in person. Use structured talking points to gather qualitative input. \n\n### Customer success and community managers\n\nYour customer success teams or community managers are usually in direct communication with your biggest clients. Enlist their help to book individual interviews or quick feedback via community channels such as customer Slack groups.\n\n### SaaS platform review sites \n\nThird-party review platforms like Capterra or G2 are great for researching customer pain points and product frustrations. Reflecting customer language from reviews can help you frame your sales storyline.\n\nWorking with other departments is the best way to gather the necessary information for your sales decks, and it ensures you’re not duplicating work. Now that you’ve shaped your customer story with concrete examples from real people, it’s time to put all the material you’ve gathered into a storytelling framework that sells."},{"title":"5 steps to rewriting the hero's journey for sales","content":"Your [sales deck](https://pitch.com/blog/sales-deck-examples) presents the most important story your team will tell.

These stages provide a clear structure for your slides.\n\n### 1. Departing from the status quo\n\nThe story begins when the hero (your prospect) realizes they’re unhappy with the status quo. Use this section to acknowledge your prospect’s pain points and explain how their current way of doing the job no longer serves them. The goal is to highlight what’s *not* working — and convince your prospect that they need to make a change. \n\n### 2. Battling the refusal of the call \n\nNext, describe the challenge a buyer faces in creating the desired change. This section is not about addressing sales objections. Fight the urge to dive into your product’s benefits, and instead address your audience’s hesitations to make a change. These hurdles may include their own doubts as well as challenges in convincing their company stakeholders.\n\n### 3. Showing the supernatural aid\n\nThis is where you introduce your product and talk about how it can help a prospect accomplish their goals. Be careful not to focus on your product’s features here. Instead, give your audience a sense of what the features will achieve for them — the everyday value. \n\n### 4. Crossing the threshold\n\nThis section overlaps with the previous section. Show your audience how they can navigate toward their desired goal, and provide them a personalized roadmap to success.\n\n### 5. Unveiling the path to success\n\nAdd depth to your story by addressing the twists and turns. Once your prospect crosses the point of no return (deciding to switch to your product), what challenges might they encounter? Draw a clear path toward success with initial onboarding tips and a timeline that includes your premium or enterprise features down the road.\n\n### Data sources to support key points\n\nMany sales presentations transform into impactful stories thanks to data. \n\nA good sales pitch uses data to substantiate its claims. The data could be your performance benchmarks compared with other companies in the same industry. It could also be social proof. Some presentations use bullet points to list stats or key findings. Other stories are best told with charts and graphs. \n\nAs with the other parts of your storytelling, focus only on data points that help prospects understand your product’s real-world applications and business impact.\n\n## How should a sales presentation story end?\n\nFor sales, a great presentation does not end with the final slide — it should resonate with your target audience long after it has been delivered.\n\nOf course, contact information right at the end is an essential reference. However, a successful pitch culminates by building sales momentum. A potential customer should understand the exact steps needed to convince decision makers and stakeholders in their company. \n\n## Free sales presentation templates\n\nNow that you have a good understanding of how to gather information and structure your sales presentation, it’s time to build your story.

Take developers or millennials — they generally don't want to have to talk to somebody to get what they need. Make sure you're to the point, and help them in a way that enables them to continue their journey.\n\n### What are key parts of the buyer journey that sales today should think about?\n\n**Curtis:** Traditional enterprise sales had multiple stages before a prospect could touch the product. Both sides used to do all this work to figure out if something was a good fit. In a product-led growth (PLG) business — purely from the user’s perspective — they discover the product, try it, and begin to understand the value of the product (often called activation) before their first conversation with sales. \n\nEven in a PLG world, sales has an important role to play. Today, sales teams often begin to add value when multiple users at a company have started to adopt the product. At this point, sales reps can help by showing customers who have already adopted the product how they can get more value out of it.\n\n### What should a sales presentation include?\n\n**Curtis:** The first thing is to remove traditional sales approaches and slides — the ones trying to understand your prospect's timeline, their budget, and the decision makers. Those aren’t the types of conversation that you should be having at first. Replace those slides with in-depth ones that show a prospect how they’re using the product well and where they can get more value.\n\n### What’s a common pitfall in product-led sales and a mindset shift for sales teams to convert?\n\n**Curtis:** One of them is thinking that product-led growth and sales do not mix. That’s not necessarily the case, but the role has shifted. Sales teams today also have so much context on the customer, and they need to leverage it. Often this can require a true cross-functional effort to expose the right data at the right time to sales. But at the end of the day, great sales reps are the ones leveraging that information.\n\nAnother common pitfall for sales teams is trying to force a conversation. Instead, sales teams should focus on making it easy for prospects to reach out. Allow people to reach out on their own schedules.\n\n### What makes a good sales presentation?\n\n**Curtis:** Every company playbook is different. When you should reach out to customers changes based on the company and the product you’re selling. A great sales presentation begins with knowing what each specific customer needs and when they need it. \n{{component:button [label:Create a free account] [href:https://app.pitch.com/?signup] [spacingTop:true] [spacingBottom:true] [spacingSize:small]}}"}],"newsletter-signup-banner":[],"excerpt":"","slug":"/guides/sales/sales-presentation-ideas","content":""},{"type":"guide","custom-slug":"guides/sales","title":"The complete guide to sales presentations","meta-image":"","meta-description":"The essential guide to building and scaling high-converting sales presentations.","intro":"While the sales pipeline used to begin with a discovery call, today,\nsales interacts with prospects throughout the buyer journey.

This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law, if permitted by a statutory permission or consent by the data subject. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data.\n\n    0. The Processor shall notify the Customer of any intended changes in relation to the consultation or replacement of further processors. In individual cases, the Customer has the right to object to the engagement of a potential further processor. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

Subject of the Agreement\n\n    In the course of the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law, if permitted by a statutory permission or consent by the data subject. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data.\n\n    0. The Processor shall notify the Customer of any intended changes in relation to the consultation or replacement of further processors. In individual cases, the Customer has the right to object to the engagement of a potential further processor. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law, if permitted by a statutory permission or consent by the data subject. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law, if permitted by a statutory permission or consent by the data subject. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law, if permitted by a statutory permission or consent by the data subject. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n\n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n\n    0. The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n\n    0. The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0. The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n\n    0. The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n\n    0. Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n\n    0. If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n\n    0. The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n\n    0. The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0. The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n\n    0. The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n\n    0. Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th in 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0. The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n\n    0. As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n\n    0. The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n\n    0. The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0. Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n    0. The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0. ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n\n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n\n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Evidence and audits\n\n    0. The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n    0. The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n\n    0. In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n\n    0. The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n\n    0. The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n\n    0. If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 11. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n\n    0. At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0. ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0. ## Liability\n\n    0. The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n\n    0. The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0. ## Final provisions\n\n    0. In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0. In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n \n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n    \n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n    \n    0.  The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0.  The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n    \n    0.  The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n    \n    0.  If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n  \n    0.  The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0.  The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://pitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitchapp.typeform.com/to/Mjivi4yI\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n    \n    0.  The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of February 5th 2010. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0.  The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n    \n    0.  As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0.  Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n\n0.  ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n  \n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n    \n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Evidence and audits\n  \n    0.  The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n    \n    0.  In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n    \n    0.  The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n    \n    0.  If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 0. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n    \n    0.  At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0.  ## Liability\n\n    0.  The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n    \n    0.  The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0.  ## Final provisions\n\n    0.  In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n    \n    0.  In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n \n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n    \n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n    \n    0.  The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0.  The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n    \n    0.  The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n    \n    0.  If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n  \n    0.  The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0.  The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order to receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://tally.so/r/mVZPby\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etally.so/r/mVZPby\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n    \n    0.  The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of June 5th 2021. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0.  The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n    \n    0.  As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0.  Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n\n0.  ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n  \n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n    \n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Evidence and audits\n  \n    0.  The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n    \n    0.  In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n    \n    0.  The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n    \n    0.  If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 0. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n    \n    0.  At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0.  ## Liability\n\n    0.  The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n    \n    0.  The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0.  ## Final provisions\n\n    0.  In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n    \n    0.  In case of conflicts between this Agreement and other arrangements of the Parties, in particular the Contract, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cspan id=\"annex-22\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## Annex 2.2\n\n### Further Information on the Processing of Customer Data\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"overflow-content\"\u003e\n  \u003ctable\u003e\n      \u003ctbody\u003e\n          \u003ctr\u003e\n              \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n              \u003ctd\u003ePurpose and extent of Data Processing\u003c/td\u003e\n              \u003ctd\u003eProvision of the Pitch software as a web application, desktop application, or mobile application, and which functions as a platform for creating, collaborating, and distributing of presentations; the collection, storage, analysis and reporting to the Customer of data and metrics of reader engagement with presentations; fulfilment of the Processor’s obligations under the Contract.

the fulfillment of the contract between Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (the \"**Processor**\") and the customer (the \"**Customer**\", together with the Processor the \"**Parties**\") regarding the provision of the Processor's software to the Customer (the \"**Contract**\"), it is possible that the Processor deals with personal data pursuant to Art. 4 no. 1 General Data Protection Regulation (\"**GDPR**\"), i.e. any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. names, addresses or phone numbers of persons who are the Customer's customers), with regard to which the Customer acts as a controller pursuant to data protection law (the \"**Customer Data**‟). This agreement (the \"**Agreement**\") specifies the data protection obligations and rights of the Parties in connection with the Processor's use of Customer Data to render the services under the Contract.\n\n0.  ## Scope of the Processing\n \n    0.  The Processor shall process the Customer Data on behalf and in accordance with the instructions of the Customer within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR. The Customer remains the controller pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.\n\n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor occurs in the manner and the scope and for the purpose determined in [Annex 2.2](#annex-22) to this Agreement; the processing relates to the types of personal data and categories of data subjects specified therein. The duration of processing corresponds to the term of the Contract.\n\n    0.  The Processor reserves the right to anonymize or aggregate the Customer Data in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individual data subjects, and to use them in this form for the purpose of needs-based designing, machine-learning, developing and optimizing as well as rendering of the services agreed as per the Contract. The Parties agree that anonymized and according to the above requirement aggregated Customer Data are not considered Customer Data for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n    0.  The Processor may process and use the Customer Data for the Processor´s own purposes as controller to the extent legally permitted by data protection law. This Agreement does not apply to such data processing.\n    \n    0.  The processing of Customer Data by the Processor shall in principle take place inside the European Union or another contracting state of the European Economic Area (EEA). The Processor is nevertheless permitted to process Customer Data in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement outside the EEA if the Processor informs the Customer in advance (e.g. in the privacy policy) about the place of data processing and if the requirements of Art. 44 to 48 GDPR are fulfilled or if an exception according to Art. 49 GDPR applies.\n\n0.  ## Right of the Customer to Issue Instructions\n\n    0.  The Processor processes the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions of the Customer, unless the Processor is legally required to do otherwise. In the latter case, the Processor shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.\n    \n    0.  The instructions of the Customer are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Agreement. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Agreement or which impose additional requirements shall require the Processor's consent.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall ensure that the Customer Data is processed in accordance with the instructions given by the Customer. If the Processor is of the opinion that an instruction given by the Customer infringes this Agreement or applicable data protection law, the Processor is after correspondingly informing the Customer entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction until the Customer confirms the instruction. The Parties agree that the sole responsibility for the processing of the Customer Data in accordance with the instructions lies with the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Legal Responsibility of the Customer\n\n    0.  The Customer is solely responsible for the permissibility of the processing of the Customer Data and for safeguarding the rights of data subjects in the relationship between the Parties. Should third parties assert claims against the Processor based on the processing of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Customer shall indemnify the Processor from all such claims upon first request.\n    \n    0.  The Customer is responsible to provide the Processor with the Customer Data in time for the rendering of services according to the Contract and the Customer is responsible for the quality of the Customer Data. The Customer shall inform the Processor immediately and completely if during the examination of the Processor's results the Customer finds errors or irregularities with regard to data protection provisions or instructions of the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Upon request, the Customer shall provide the Processor with the information specified in Art. 30 para. 2 GDPR, insofar as it is not already available to the Processor.\n    \n    0.  If the Processor is required to provide information to a governmental body or person on the processing of Customer Data or to cooperate with these bodies in any other way, the Customer is obliged to assist the Processor at first request in providing such information and in fulfilling other appropriate cooperation obligations.\n\n0.  ## Requirements for Personnel and Systems\n\n    The Processor shall commit all persons engaged in processing Customer Data to confidentiality with respect to the processing of Customer Data.\n\n0.  ## Security of Processing\n  \n    0.  The Processor takes necessary appropriate technical and organizational measures according to Art. 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the Customer Data, as well as the different likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in order to ensure a level of protection of Customer Data appropriate to the risk. The implemented technical and organizational measures include the measures as listed in [Annex 6.1](#annex-61).\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organizational measures during the term of this Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the statutory requirements.\n\n0.  ## Engagement of Further Processors\n\n    0.  The Customer grants the Processor the general authorization to engage further processors with regard to the processing of Customer Data. Further processors engaged at the time of conclusion of this Agreement are listed in [Annex 7.2](#annex-72). In general, no authorization is required for contractual relationships with service providers that are concerned with the examination or maintenance of data processing procedures or systems by third parties or that involve other additional services, even if access to Customer Data cannot be excluded, as long as the Processor takes reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Data. In order to receive notifications with respect to adding or replacing existing subprocessors Customer may subscribe to a mailing list using to following link: \u003ca href=\"https://tally.so/r/mVZPby\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etally.so/r/mVZPby\u003c/a\u003e. Subprocessor notifications will occur no later than 14 days prior to any changes, in order to allow for Customer to object. An objection may only be raised by the Customer for important reasons which have to be substantiated vis-à-vis the Processor. Insofar as the Customer does not object within 14 days after receipt of the notification, the Customer´s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the Customer objects, the Processor is entitled to terminate the Contract and this Agreement with a notice period of three months until the end of a month.\n    \n    0.  The agreement between the Processor and the further processor must impose the same obligations on the further processor as those incumbent upon the Processor under this Agreement. The Parties agree that this requirement is fulfilled if the contract has a level of protection corresponding to this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  Subject to compliance with the requirements of Sec. 2.5 of this Agreement, the provisions of this Sec. 7 shall also apply if a further processor in a third country is involved. The Customer hereby authorises the Processor to conclude an agreement with another processor on behalf of the Customer based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries pursuant to the decision of the European Commission of June 5th 2021. The Customer declares its willingness to cooperate in fulfilling the requirements of Art. 49 GDPR to the extent necessary.\n\n0.  ## Data Subjects' Rights\n\n    0.  The Processor shall support the Customer within reason by virtue of technical and organisational measures in fulfilling the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising data subjects' rights.\n    \n    0.  As far as a data subject submits a request for the exercise of its rights directly to the Processor, the Processor will forward this request to the Customer in a timely manner.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall inform the Customer of any information relating to the stored Customer Data, about the recipients of Customer Data to which the Processor may disclose it in accordance with the instructions and about the purpose of storage, as far as the Customer does not have this information at its disposal and as far as the Customer is not able to collect it itself.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall, within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary, enable the Customer to correct, delete or restrict the further processing of Customer Data, or at the instruction of the Customer correct, block or restrict further processing itself, if and to the extent that this is impossible for the Customer. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  Insofar as the data subject has a right of data portability vis-à-vis the Customer in respect of the Customer Data pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, the Processor shall support the Customer within the bounds of what is reasonable and necessary in handing over the Customer Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, if the Customer is unable to obtain the data elsewhere. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n0.  ## Notification and Support Obligations of the Processor\n\n    0.  Insofar as the Customer is subject to a statutory notification obligation due to a breach of the security regarding the Customer Data (in particular pursuant to Art. 33, 34 GDPR), the Processor shall inform the Customer in a timely manner of any reportable events in the Processor´s area of responsibility. The Processor shall assist the Customer in fulfilling the notification obligations at the Processor's request to the extent reasonable and necessary. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n    \n    0.  The Processor shall assist the Customer to the extent reasonable and necessary with data protection impact assessments to be carried out by the Customer and, if necessary, subsequent consultations with the supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 35, 36 GDPR. In this case, the Processor shall be reimbursed for the expenses and costs incurred by the Processor in this regard and substantiated vis-à-vis the Customer.\n\n\n0.  ## Deletion and Return of Customer Data\n  \n    0.  Upon termination of this Agreement, the Processor shall, in the discretion of the Customer, \u003cbr\u003e\n        a.  either delete or return the Customer Data; and \u003cbr\u003e\n        b.  delete existing copies thereof \u003cbr\u003e\n        unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store the Customer Data.\n    \n    0.  The Processor may keep documentations which serve as evidence of the orderly and accurate processing of Customer Data, also after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Evidence and audits\n  \n    0.  The Processor shall provide the Customer, at the Customer's request, with all information required and available to the Processor to prove compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall be entitled to audit (including inspections) the Processor with regard to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, in particular the implementation of the technical and organisational measures.\n    \n    0.  In order to carry out inspections in accordance with Sec. 11.2., the Customer is entitled to access the business premises of the Processor in which Customer Data is processed within the usual business hours (Mondays to Fridays from 10 am to 6 pm) after timely advance notification in accordance with Sec. 11.5 at its own expense, without disruption of the course of business and under strict secrecy of the Processor's business and trade secrets.\n    \n    0.  The Processor is entitled, at its own discretion and taking into account the Customer's legal obligations, not to disclose information which is sensitive with regard to the Processor's business or if the Processor would be in breach of statutory or other contractual provisions as a result of its disclosure. The Customer is not entitled to get access to data or information about the Processor's other customers, cost information, quality control and contract management reports, or any other confidential data of the Processor that is not directly relevant for the agreed audit purposes.\n    \n    0.  The Customer shall inform the Processor in good time (usually at least two weeks in advance) of all circumstances in relation to the performance of the audit. The Customer may carry out not more than one audit per calendar year.\n    \n    0.  If the Customer commissions a third party to carry out the audit, the Customer shall obligate the third party in writing in the same way as the Customer is obliged vis-à-vis the Processor according to this Sec. 0. In addition, the Customer shall by way of written agreement obligate the third party to maintain secrecy and confidentiality unless the third party is subject to a professional obligation of secrecy. At the request of the Processor, the Customer shall immediately submit to the Processor the commitment and confidentiality agreements with the third party. The Customer may not commission any of the Processor's competitors to carry out the audit.\n    \n    0.  At the discretion of the Processor, proof of compliance with the obligations under this Agreement may be provided, instead of an inspection, by submitting an appropriate current opinion or report from an independent authority (e.g. auditor, audit department, data protection officer, IT security department, data protection auditors or quality auditors) or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (the \"**Audit Report**\"), if the Audit Report makes it possible for the Customer in an appropriate manner to convince itself of the Processor's compliance with the contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.\n\n0.  ## Contract term and termination\n\n    The term and termination of this Agreement shall be governed by the term and termination provisions of the Contract. A termination of the Contract automatically results in a cancellation of this Agreement. An isolated termination of this contract is excluded.\n\n0.  ## Liability\n\n    0.  The Processor's liability under this Agreement shall be governed by the disclaimers and limitations of liability provided for in the Contract. As far as third parties assert claims against the Processor which are caused by the Customer's culpable breach of this Agreement or one of the Customer´s obligations as the controller in terms of data protection law, the Customer shall upon first request indemnify and hold the Processor harmless from these claims.\n    \n    0.  The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Processor upon first request against all possible fines imposed on the Processor corresponding to the Customer's part of responsibility for the infringement sanctioned by the fine.\n\n0.  ## Final provisions\n\n    0.  In case individual provisions of this Agreement are ineffective or become ineffective or contain a gap, the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The Parties undertake to replace the ineffective provision by a legally permissible provision which comes closest to the purpose of the ineffective provision and that thereby satisfies the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.\n    \n    0.

Data protection focuses on protecting assets from unauthorized use, while data privacy defines who is authorized to access the data in the first place. \n\nOne important difference is who controls which part. With data privacy, controls are mostly given to the user (in other words, the user can control which data is shared with whom), while data protection is mostly a company's responsibility.\n\n**What is personal data?** \n\nPersonal data is defined as any data that can be linked back to a natural person. Everything you do online - from creating a Facebook account to posting a photo on Instagram - leaves a digital footprint. While it may seem small, it adds up and unprotected, an individual is vulnerable to having their personal data shared with third parties. Luckily, data privacy law focuses on ensuring an individual's rights are secure. \n\n**What's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?**\n\nToday, data protection law impacts organizations and governments around the world. The EU implemented a higher protection threshold than most other countries with the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. GDPR introduced changes to previous data protection and data privacy law, specifically around areas like consent, reporting obligations, internal procedures, accountability, and penalties.\n\n**Does GDPR apply to me?**\n\nYes. GDPR applies to you too even if you are located outside of the EEA (European Economic Area). It applies to any business that a) markets their products to people in the EEA or b) monitors the behavior of people in the EEA. In other words, even if you’re based outside of the EEA, if you control or process the data of EU citizens, GDPR applies to you.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I manage my data?\n\n* See a list of our subprocessors in Annex 7.2. of our [DPA.](https://pitch.com/dpa)\n* Ask us what kind of your personal data Pitch has stored.\n* You can unsubscribe from all marketing emails by emailing us at [support@pitch.com](mailto:support@pitch.com)\n* Ask us to delete your personal data we may have stored.\n* For any other GDPR related question, please reach out to us at [privacy@pitch.com](mailto:privacy@pitch.com)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n### Where is my data stored?\n\nPitch is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The servers where Pitch's data is stored are located in Ireland (eu-west-1 region).\n\n### What are the steps Pitch has taken to ensure we are GDPR compliant?\n\nPitch was founded shortly before GDPR came into effect. As a result, we have been focused on ensuring GDPR compliance from the beginning.\n\nWe have signed DPAs with all of our third-party business providers (sub-processors). If you want to know more about these Data Processing Agreements, [click here](https://pitch.com/dpa) and go to Annex 7.2. \n\nIn addition to external efforts, we have taken a number of steps to ensure GDPR compliance at all levels of the company. We require all employees to undergo GDPR training and have created a Data Protection Handbook that details our internal procedures related to data. In addition, we have a dedicated Data Protection Officer who can be reached at [dpo@pitch.com](mailto:dpo@pitch.com).\n\nIf you are a business customer of Pitch, you can find our Data Processing Agreement [here](https://pitch.com/dpa).

The data collected in this way is statistically processed and usually anonymous, i.e. we cannot establish any reference to the individual person.\n\nInformation on these page insights and data processing can be found, for example, in Facebook's data protection statement at \u003chttps://www.facebook.com/policy.php\u003e or at \u003chttps://www.facebook.com/business/a/page/page-insights\u003e.\n\nFacebook also uses cookies and storage technologies.

Questions?\n\nFor further information you may contact us any time, for example via email to [privacy@pitch.com](mailto:privacy@pitch.com).\n"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":true,"title":"Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy","date":"2024-02-13T14:08:20.982Z","customSlug":"/security-disclosure-policy","excerpt":"At Pitch we truly appreciate when ethical hackers, security researchers, or any well-intentioned person report a security vulnerability to us. We take security seriously and we will respond diligently to any email sent to security@pitch.com","slug":"/security-disclosure-policy","content":"At Pitch we truly appreciate when ethical hackers, security researchers, or any well-intentioned person report a security vulnerability to us. We take security seriously and we will respond diligently to any email sent to [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com)\n\nThe goal of this document is to define how to engage with Pitch Security Team. Please read it in full if you believe to have found a security vulnerability in our application or infrastructure.\n\n## Scope\n\nPlease, only report issues related to the following:\n\n- Any website or service served from the [pitch.com](http://pitch.com/) domain\n- Any website or service served from the [pitch.io](http://pitch.io/) domain\n- Desktop applications\n- Mobile applications\n- Official integrations\n- Open-source projects [pitch-io/cljest](https://github.com/pitch-io/cljest) and [pitch-io/uix](https://github.com/pitch-io/uix)\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following reports — without an exploit proof-of-concept — will be classified as Not Applicable (N/A) or Informational. Every proof-of-concept always needs to comply with our Guidelines.\n\n- Volumetric vulnerabilities (i.e. simply overwhelming our service with a high volume of requests);\n- TLS configuration weaknesses (e.g. \"weak\" cipher suite support, TLS1.0 support, sweet32, etc);\n- Reports indicating that our services do not fully align with \"best practice\" (e.g. missing security headers or sub-optimal email-related configuration);\n- Vulnerabilities or weaknesses in third-party services or sub-processors (but we might help you report them to the right vendor if we consider the report valid).\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nIn response to your initial email to [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com), you will receive an acknowledgment reply email from the security team (usually within 5 working days of your report being received).\n\nFollowing the initial contact, our security team will work to triage the reported vulnerability and will respond to you as soon as possible to confirm whether further information is required and/or whether the vulnerability qualifies as per the above scope, or is a duplicate report.\n\nFrom this point, necessary remediation work will be assigned to the appropriate teams. Priority for bug fixes and/or mitigation will be assigned based on the severity of impact and complexity of exploitation.\n\nVulnerability reports may take some time to triage and/or remediate. You’re welcome to inquire on the status of the process but please limit this to no more than once every 14 days to help our security team focus on the reports as much as possible.\n\nOur security team will notify you when the reported vulnerability is resolved (or remediation work is scheduled) and will ask you to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately. We will offer you the opportunity to provide feedback to us on the process and relationship as well as the vulnerability resolution. This information will be used in strict confidence to help us improve how we handle reports and/or develop services and resolve vulnerabilities.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nIn accordance with industry standards, we ask that reporters provide a benign (i.e. non-destructive) proof of exploitation wherever possible. This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately while also reducing the likelihood of duplicate reports and/or malicious exploitation for some vulnerability classes (e.g. sub-domain takeovers).\n\nWe require that all researchers:\n\n- Avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production services, and destruction or manipulation of data;\n- Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability, and stop testing and report the issue immediately if you gain access to any non-public application, any private data, or non-public credentials;\n- Add the header `Pentest: Researcher` to your requests during the tests;\n- Avoid aggressive scanners, automated tools, and volumetric attacks;\n- Do not send more than 2 requests per second;\n- Submit any necessary screenshots, screen records, cURL requests, and reproduction steps to help our security team reproduce the vulnerability;\n- Not disclose any vulnerabilities in Pitch systems/services to 3rd parties/the public **before** the Pitch confirming that those vulnerabilities have been mitigated or rectified. This does not prevent notification of a vulnerability to 3rd parties to whom the vulnerability is directly relevant, for example where the vulnerability being reported is in a software library or framework – but details of the specific vulnerability in Pitch must not be referenced in such reports. If you are unsure about the status of a 3rd party to whom you wish to send notification, please email [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com) for clarification;\n- Ensure you understand the targets, scopes, exclusions, and guidelines;\n\nWe request that all data retrieved during research be securely deleted as soon as it is no longer required and at most, one month after the vulnerability is resolved, whichever occurs soonest.\n\nIf you are unsure at any stage whether the actions you are thinking of taking are acceptable, please contact our security team for guidance at [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com). Please do not include any sensitive information in the initial communications.\n\n## Rewards and Bug Bounty\n\nWe do not currently run a bug bounty at Pitch. For vulnerabilities of relevant interest and impact in our application and infrastructure, we will review them at per-case basics regarding any type of reward.\n\n## Coordinated Disclosure\n\nIf the vulnerabilities are related to our clients (Desktop, iOS, and Android) or our open-source projects, and the patch requires user interaction, we commit to fixing critical vulnerabilities within 90 days and disclosing details upon patch release.\n\n## Legalities and **Safe Harbor**\n\nThis policy is designed to be compatible with common good practices among well-intentioned security researchers. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law or cause the Pitch to be in breach of any of its legal obligations, including but not limited to:\n\n- The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)\n\nPitch will not seek prosecution of any security researcher who reports, in good faith and in accordance with this policy, any security vulnerability on an in-scope Pitch service.\n\nPitch is obligated to follow EU and international laws. This means that we aren’t able to pay bounties to residents or those who report vulnerabilities from a country against which the European Union has trade restrictions or export sanctions as determined by the European Union. We are also subject to additional rules from the European Union and UK. **Therefore Pitch will not be processing payments to hackers located in any sanctioned region including Belarus, Russia, or sanctioned areas of Ukraine.** \n\n**Feedback**\n\nIf you wish to provide feedback or suggestions on this policy, please contact our security team at [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com). This policy will evolve over time and your input will be valued to ensure that it is clear, complete, and remains relevant.\n\nThank you for helping keep Pitch and our users safe!"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":true,"title":"Security Policy","date":"2024-10-29T10:11:39.470Z","customSlug":"/security-policy","excerpt":"Security is very important to Pitch and everyone here is doing their best to keep your presentations and data secure. This document describes our internal security policies and how those translate into creating a secure platform that you can trust.","slug":"/security-policy","content":"Security is very important to Pitch and everyone here is doing their best to keep your presentations and data secure. This document describes our internal security policies and how those translate into creating a secure platform that you can trust.\n\n## Data Protection\n\nYou can read our [Data Processing Agreement](https://pitch.com/dpa) in full as a recap.\n\n## GDPR\n\nWe are committed to follow and implement all the guidelines and recommendations from GDPR with regards to all the data and information we handle, process, and store at Pitch.\n\n## Data Security\n\nAll of Pitch infrastructure runs in Amazon AWS, hosted in European regions. You can find more information about AWS security practices on [their cloud security page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).\n\n### Data Encryption at Rest\n\nWe use different Amazon AWS services, such as AuroraDB and S3, and we configured them to use AES-256 encryption for all data at rest.\n\n### Data Classification\n\nWe like to keep our data organized, and for that we created different categories on which all Pitch's data needs to be categorized. The categories define who can access it and which level of monitoring they receive:\n\n1. Public information - Information available in our main website and marketing information\n2. Internal information - Unreleased information and details about Pitch roadmap\n3. Private information - Details about Pitch operational data\n4. Confidential information - Customers' data and Pitch employees' information\n\n### Data Transport Security\n\nAll communications with Pitch servers is done over TLS. We do this so no one can eavesdrop on communications between your machine and our application. To ensure the maximum protection for every user, we have added our domain to the HTST Preload list, which will ensure browsers do not connect to our application if it is not over HTTPS.\n\n## Application Security\n\n### Code Security\n\nAt Pitch we inspect closely any code before it is release. Our developers inspect the logic and information flows of each new feature to ensure no security vulnerabilities are introduced. But because humans aren't perfect we also write tests to ensure the application does not behave in an unexpected way.\n\nWe also run semiautomatic scanning tools, like Burp Suite, for new features to find any security problems.\n\n### Authentication\n\nWe partner with Auth0 for the authentication of our users. They offer a robust solution to ensure our users' passwords are stored securely and an OAuth solution so users can sign in with their Google accounts. Read more about it here: [](https://auth0.com/security)\u003chttps://auth0.com/security\u003e\n\n### Third-Party components\n\nTo not reinvent the wheel, we use third-party libraries to make our application better every day. Of course, it is never as simple as using a component and then forgetting about it, so at Pitch we review and monitor our third-party components for known vulnerabilities using automatic systems like Dependabot. Each report is analyzed and acted on based on the criticality of the vulnerability, with a response time from one day for critical vulnerabilities to eight days for medium risk vulnerabilities (as defined by their [CVSS score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)).\n\n## Infrastructure Security\n\n### Network Segmentation\n\nInside our Amazon AWS infrastructure we segment our network into different areas, decoupling our production environments from our testing and development environments.\n\n### Incident Monitoring\n\nWe use Datadog monitoring services to alert us on any anomalous behaviour in our infrastructure. We also use Amazon AWS Cloudtrail to monitor any suspicious activity within our backend systems.\n\n### Google Integrations\n\nOur Google integrations we follow their [security requirements for OAuth API](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914) and our solution is verified and trusted by Google.\n\n## Organizational Security\n\n### Security Incident Management\n\nOur systems monitor for anomalous and suspicious activity across the different systems we use to run the platform. These events are fed into a central dashboard that provides us with an overview of how every component is behaving and alerts us if a problem is detected.\n\nEach and every incident at Pitch goes through the same rigorous internal incident management process. This allows us to ensure no stone is left unturned and the root cause of the incident is resolved. The process also describes how to escalate and communicate these incidents to the different parties involved.\n\n### Asset Management\n\nWe maintain and regularly update an internal Threat Model of our infrastructure, assets, and application. We define the type of data and risk that each component is exposed to and how we protect these. This help us in segregating our infrastructure and maintaining a minimum access policy approach.\n\n## Operational Security\n\n### Backups\n\nPitch's infrastructure is built on top of Amazon AWS and we use their services to generate daily backups for our database that are then retained for up to 30 days. To ensure data recovery process is working as intended, we execute data recovery exercises regularly.\n\n### Risk Management\n\nWe perform periodic risk analysis and assessments to ensure that our information security policies and practices meet the requirements and applicable regulatory obligations.\n\n### Security Vulnerability Disclosure\n\nWe always appreciate when Pitch users and security researchers contact us regarding security vulnerabilities. You can reach us at [security@pitch.com](mailto:security@pitch.com) and read our full policy at [Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://pitch.com/security-disclosure-policy).\n"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":false,"title":"Terms of Use","version":"1.0.1","date":"2019-07-14","customSlug":"/terms-of-use","excerpt":"\n1.

How to Contact Us\n\nYou may contact us at any time via:\n\nPitch Software GmbH, Joachimstrasse 7, 10119, Berlin, Germany\n\nphone:  +49 30 9837 0206\n\nemail: [hello@pitch.com](mailto:hello@pitch.com)\n"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":false,"title":"Terms of Use","version":"1.1.0","date":"2020-03-24","customSlug":"/terms-of-use","excerpt":"\nPitch Software GmbH","slug":"/terms-of-use/v1-1-0","content":"\n## Pitch Software GmbH\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"long-list\"\u003e\n\n1. ### Scope of Application and General Provisions\n\n    1. These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as \"**ToU**\") apply to the provision and use of Pitch’s cross-platform Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (hereinafter referred to as \"**Software**\", substantiated in Section 3.2) by Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (hereinafter referred to as \"**Pitch**\"). Free services offered by Pitch address both consumers (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code, and businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code. Paid Plans (as defined in Section 3.2) are offered exclusively to companies or persons that legally qualify as entrepreneurs (*Unternehmer*) (the respective customer hereinafter referred to as \"**Customer**\", together with Pitch the \"**Parties**\").\n\n    2. For the avoidance of doubt: The Customer is a consumer (*Verbraucher*) insofar as the purpose of the subscribed services is predominantly outside his trade, business or profession. On the other hand, an entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) is any natural or legal person or partnership with legal personality who or which, when concluding the Contract, acts in the exercise of his or its trade, business or profession.\n\n    3. Deviations from these ToU shall only be considered agreed if they have expressly been confirmed in writing by Pitch. In particular, the mere omission of an objection by Pitch against any general terms and conditions of the Customer shall not cause such terms and conditions to be considered agreed. This shall also apply if Pitch performs Services unconditionally upon knowledge of opposing terms and conditions of the Customer or terms and conditions diverging from these ToU.\n\n    4. For important reasons, in particular in the event of changes to statutory provisions, judicial precedences, the Software or market conditions, Pitch may notify the Customer of amendments to these ToU. The amended ToU shall be deemed to have been agreed if the Customer has not objected to the amendment within one month upon receipt of the notification and Pitch has explicitly notified the Customer of this consequence. Regardless of the foregoing, changes to the scope of the Contractual Service (*Umfang der geschuldeten Leistungen)* require the express consent of the Customer.\n\n2. ### Conclusion of Contract\n\n    1. To access the Service, the Customer must first select a supported login method to start the signup process. Subsequently, by checking the respective boxes, the Customer accepts the then current versions of Pitch’s ToU, privacy policy ([https://pitch.com/privacy-policy](https://pitch.com/privacy-policy)), and data processing agreement ([https://pitch.com/dpa](https://pitch.com/dpa)). By clicking on the button \"Next\", the Customer accepts Pitch's offer to conclude a contract (the \"**Contract**\") including these ToU. Upon completion of the signup process, a workspace is created to which the Customer can invite other users (each user a “**Workspace Member**”) to collaborate on presentations.\n\n    2. In subscribing to a Paid Plan, the Customer guarantees that the Customer acts in the capacity as entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code (*Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch*, BGB).\n\n3. ### Scope of Services\n\n    1. The Software is a cross-platform SaaS application for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (the “**Contract Purpose**”). The provision of the Software – in the case of agreed Individual Services pursuant to Section 5 in the adapted version – shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Service**”.\n\n    2. Pitch may offer free plans (each a “**Free Plan**”) and paid plans (each a “**Paid Plan**”) for the subscription to the Service. The individually agreed scope of Service of the Contract between the Customer and Pitch shall be based on the respective Free Plan or Paid Plan as described on the Pricing Page and selected by the Customer (such selected plan the \"**Plan**\"). The Service owed by Pitch according to the contractually agreed scope of Service shall hereinafter be referred to as \"**Contractual Services**\"; the term \"**Software**\" shall only include those parts of the Software which are covered by the contractually agreed scope of services.\n\n    3. Pitch reserves the right to remove certain features from the Free Plans at its own discretion.\n\n    4. Upon completion of the signup process, the Customer may add and remove other users to the workspace. On a Free Plan, adding additional users is free of charge. On a Paid Plan, adding additional users incurs cost as per the Pricing Page. Each paying user in a workspace is referred to as a “**Paid Seat**”.\n\n    5. The Customer may upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan, or switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan at any time; in this case, from the time of the switch the details concerning the scope of services, remuneration, etc. of the new Plan stated on the Pricing Page shall apply. A switch to a cheaper Plan is only permissible with the consent of Pitch or if the notice period specified in these ToU or on the Pricing Page is observed.\n\n    6. The Customer may at any time decrease or increase the number of Paid Seats. Decreasing or increasing the number of Paid Seats does not affect the term or terminability of the Customer’s Plan. In case of increase, the cost for each increase is subject to the provisions of the applicable Pricing Page and is calculated on a pro-rated basis under consideration of the billing period of the Customer’s Plan. In case of decrease, the compensation owed by the Customer under his Plan proportionately decreases with effect as of the next billing period of his Plan.\n\n4. ### Use of the Software by the Customer\n\n    1. The Software is used by means of telecommunications via the browser or a stand-alone application.\n\n    2. The Customer may only use the access to the Software itself and for the contractually agreed purpose.\n\n    3. The Customer undertakes to take appropriate security precautions to ensure that access to the Software is not used by unauthorised persons. Such security precautions include in particular the use of a secure password.\n\n    4. The Customer may only enter data, texts, pictures and other content (including custom fonts) into the Software\n\n        1. that comply with applicable law;\n\n        2. that do not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the entering of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the content uploaded by the Customer for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it available for retrieval.\n\n        Pitch is entitled to delete content uploaded by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not entered into the Software in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    5. Content included in the Software, in particular pictures, graphics and/or fonts, may only be used for the purposes of this Contract.\n\n    6. The Customer agrees not to upload, transmit, support, incite, promote or otherwise make available any content that is or could reasonably be viewed as unlawful, racist, hostile, violent, discriminatory (including relating to race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin), harmful, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable or which contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.\n\n    7. The Customer indemnifies and holds Pitch harmless from all claims by third parties (in particular from claims arising out of breach of copyright, competition, trademark or data protection law) that are asserted against Pitch in connection with the Customer’s use of the Software insofar as such claims do not result from wilful or grossly negligent behaviour of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen)*. This indemnification obligation comprises the reimbursement for appropriate costs that Pitch incurred in the course of asserting or defending its legal rights in this context.\n\n5. ### Software Adaptation\n\n    1. If agreed between the Parties, Pitch shall, in addition to providing the Service, provide services to adapt the Software to the individual needs and wishes of the Customer (\"**Individual Services**\"). An agreement on this shall be reached by separate service agreement between the Parties (the “**Individual Service Agreement**”).\n\n    2. Pitch shall provide the Individual Services in accordance with the provisions of the Individual Service Agreement and shall receive the remuneration provided therein in return. The Customer is obliged to provide all cooperation required for the performance of the Individual Services.\n\n6. ### Availability\n\n    1. Pitch shall not be responsible for establishing and maintaining the data link between the Customer's IT systems and the Transfer Point. \"**Transfer Point**\" shall mean the router exit of the Pitch data centre or its subcontractor's data centre through whose server the Software is operated. Pitch is not responsible for malfunctions beyond the Transfer Point. The Customer is responsible for the procurement and maintenance of the necessary hardware and connections to public telecommunications networks. The costs of setting up the online connection and maintaining it on the Customer's side shall be borne by the Customer. Pitch is not liable for the security, confidentiality or integrity of the data communication, which is conducted via third party communication networks. Pitch is also not liable for malfunctions in data transmission caused by technical errors or configuration problems on the part of the Customer.\n\n    2. The Software availability owed by Pitch depends on the Plan chosen by the Customer and is specified on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any regulations, the following applies: If the Customer has chosen a Free Plan, Pitch does not owe any availability. If the Customer has chosen a Paid Plan, Pitch shall owe an Availability of at least 99% in the Contract's yearly average.\n\n    3. Pitch strives to provide the Customer with the best possible customer experience. However, contractually, Pitch does not owe the comprehensive error-free operation and usability of the Software. Pitch only owes that the Customer can use the Software for the Contract Purpose at the level of Availability as set out in Section 6.2. “**Availability**” means that the Customer can access and use the main features of the Software. Times during which the Software is not available due to an error or other reasons are considered “**Downtime**”.\n\n    4. For determining the Availability, such Downtime is not taken into account\n\n        1. in which the Software cannot be reached due to technical or other problems for which Pitch is not responsible (force majeure, third-party fault, errors in the IT systems of the Customer or the third party service providers acting on his behalf, etc.);\n\n        2. which is due to a breach of the Customer's obligation to cooperate, in particular to a delayed or incomplete transmission of an error message; or\n\n        3. which is used for normal maintenance work of up to five hours a month.\n\n7. ### Software Operation and Changes\n\n    1. Pitch intends to use state-of-the-art technology and shall be entitled to regularly carry out or introduce updates, new versions or upgrades of the Software (hereinafter referred to uniformly as “**Updates**”) in order to adapt the Software to new technical or commercial requirements, to implement new features, or to make changes to existing features in order to improve the Software.\n\n    2. If and insofar as the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose is materially impaired by an Update (such an Update a “**Material Change”**), Pitch shall inform the Customer in text form of the introduction of the Material Change at least four weeks prior to it becoming effective (a “**Change Notice**”). If the Customer does not object to the Material Change within two weeks after receipt of the Change Notice in text form (the “**Objection Notice**”), the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. With each Change Notice, Pitch shall inform the Customer of the Customer’s rights pursuant to this Section 7.2, in particular: (i) the objection right, (ii) the period foreseen for objection and (iii) the legal consequences of not declaring an objection to the Material Change in time.\n\n    3. If the Customer objects to the Material Change, Pitch shall further provide the Software for use to the Customer without the Material Change unless this is impossible for technical or organizational reasons or Pitch cannot reasonably be expected to do so. In the latter case, the Customer is entitled to terminate the Contract extraordinarily for good cause within four weeks (the “**Exercise Period**”). If the Customer does not make use of its termination right, the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. The Exercise Period shall commence as soon as Pitch has informed the Customer in text form of (i) the non-continuability of the Contract without the Material Change, (ii) the Customer’s extraordinary termination right and (iii) the legal consequences of the expiry of the Exercise Period.\n\n8. ### Publication of Content on pitch.com\n\n    1. The Customer may have the option to make presentations created by the Customer, including data, text, pictures and other content (the “**Customer Content**”), publicly accessible via the pitch.com platform (the “pitch.com Platform”).\n\n    2. The Customer may only publish Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform\n\n        1. that complies with applicable law;\n\n        2. that does not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the publishing of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the Customer Content for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it accessible via the pitch.com Platform.\n\n        Pitch does not review the Customer Content before publishing. Pitch is entitled to delete content published by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not published in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    3. The provisions in Section 4.6 and 4.7 apply to the publication of Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform accordingly.\n\n9. ### Compensation and Terms of Payment\n\n    1. The compensation for the use of the Software by the Customer and the respective terms of payment shall be based on the Pricing Page available at [www.pitch.com/pricing](https://pitch.com/pricing). The Contract is governed by the current version of the Pricing Page at the time the Contract is concluded or the switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan or the upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan according to Section 3.5 is performed (in the applicable version the \"**Pricing Page**\"). In case of renewal of a Paid Plan according to Section 18.2, the version of the pricing page applicable to the Customer does not change but remains the same.\n\n    2. All fees and prices indicated by Pitch are net prices without VAT. The payment period depends on the Paid Plan chosen by the Customer and as set out on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment period, the compensation is to be paid monthly in advance upon receipt of the respective invoice issued by Pitch. Invoices are sent by Pitch to the Customer via email.\n\n    3. The available payment options are detailed on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment options, payments can be made via credit card.\n\n10. ### Warranty for Material and Legal Defects\n\n    1. Pitch warrants that the Software corresponds to the agreed scope of Service when used in accordance with the Contract and that it is not encumbered with material or legal defects (“**Defects**”) which more than insignificantly impair the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose. Immaterial deviations shall not be considered as Defects.\n\n    2. The Customer shall be obliged to communicate any Defect to Pitch immediately upon appearance. Pitch shall remedy any duly notified Defects appearing in the Software within a reasonable period of time.\n\n11. ### Liability\n\n    1. The no-fault based liability pursuant to Section 536a(1) German Civil Code for Defects in the Software existing at the time of contracting shall be excluded, unless the Defect relates to a feature of the Software essential for the Contract Purpose\n\n    2. Pitch is liable for damages if arising from (i) willful misconduct or gross negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen*), (ii) negligent violation of a material contractual duty (*Kardinalpflichten*) by Pitch or its legal representatives or agents, however, limited to typical damages which are foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the Contract or (iii) negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents in a way causing injury to life, body or health, or (iv) any compulsory statutory liability of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents. Material contractual duties (*Kardinalspflichten*) are duties the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for proper execution of the Contract or the breach of which endangers attainment of the Contract Purpose and the observance of which the Customer must regularly rely on.\n\n    3. Any contributory negligence on the part of the Customer shall be taken into account. In particular, Pitch shall only be liable for the recovery of data if the Customer has taken all necessary and reasonable data backup precautions and ensured that the data can be recovered at reasonable cost from data material kept in machine-readable form.\n\n    4. This liability arrangement is conclusive. It shall apply with respect to all damage compensation claims, irrespective of their legal ground, particularly also with respect to pre-contractual claims or collateral contractual claims. This liability arrangement shall also apply in favor of legal representatives and agents of Pitch if claims are asserted directly against them.\n\n    5. The Customer is obliged to immediately notify any damage pursuant to the above liability provisions to Pitch in text form or to have such damage documented by Pitch, so that Pitch is informed as early as possible and can possibly still mitigate the damage together with the Customer.\n\n12. ### Non-contractual Use, Damages\n\n    1. For each case in which a Contractual Service is used unauthorisedly under the responsibility of the Customer, the Customer shall pay damages in the amount of the compensation that would have been due for the contractual use under the minimum contract period applicable to this Service. The Customer reserves the right to prove that the Customer is not responsible for the unauthorised use or that there is no damage or considerably less damage.\n\n    2. Pitch remains entitled to claim further damages.\n\n13. ### Limitation of Claims\n\n    1. Claims of the Customer based on the breach of any duty not consisting of a Defect become time-barred, except in the event of intention or gross negligence, within one year from beginning of the limitation period. This shall not apply if the damage in question incurred by the Customer consists in personal injury. Claims for personal injury become statute-barred within the statutory limitation period.\n\n    2. Any rescission of contract or reduction of payments shall be invalid if the claim to performance or subsequent performance of the Customer has become time-barred.\n\n14. ### Copyright and License\n\n    1. The Software is protected by copyright. Pitch represents that the general operation of the Software is permitted by law, does not violate any statutes, regulations or directives and, in particular, does not infringe on any third party rights. Pitch undertakes to indemnify the Customer against legitimate third party claims due to the operation of the Software and to compensate the Customer for any damage incurred in this context (including reasonable costs of legal defense) in accordance with Section 11.\n\n    2. The Customer shall have the non-transferrable, non-exclusive right, temporally restricted to the term of the Contract, to use the Service (if applicable, including a Software adaptation carried out in accordance with Section 5) via the Internet for the contractual purpose agreed under the Contract. The Customer shall not obtain any rights beyond this. In particular, the Customer is not entitled to make the Software accessible to third Parties or to use them in any other way outside the purpose of the Contract. In particular, the Customer has to refrain from copying, decompiling, reverse engineering or editing the Service beyond the Contract Purpose.\n\n    3. The Software includes open source software provided by third parties (see list [here](https://c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953.try.pitch.com/c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953/third-party-notices.html)).\n\n15. ### Feedback\n\n    The Customer agrees that Pitch may freely use, exploit and further develop any feedback provided by the Customer.\n\n16. ### Purchase of Rights to Third Party Content\n\n    1. The Service may include the possibility of the Customer to acquire the right to use, reproduce, copy or disseminate content (e.g. pictures or videos) owned or licensed by third parties (“**Third Party Content**”). In this case, Pitch acts as reseller of the entity or person owning or licensing the Third Party Content.\n\n    2. The compensation, payment conditions and other provisions regarding the purchase of Third Party Content by the Customer via the Software as well as the scope of the rights of use shall be governed by the provisions contained on the Pricing Page applicable at the time of the respective purchase. If the Pricing Page contains no provisions, the Parties will conclude a separate agreement thereon.\n\n17. ### Set-off, Reduction, Retention\n\n    1. The Customer shall only have a right of set-off, reduction and/or retention against Pitch if its counterclaim has been legally established, undisputed or acknowledged by Pitch.\n\n    2. Furthermore, the Customer may only exercise a right of retention if the counterclaim is based on the same contractual relationship.\n\n    3. The Customer's right to reclaim remuneration not actually owed shall remain unaffected by the limitation of Section 17.1.\n\n18. ### Term and Termination\n\n    1. The term of the Contract and terminability shall be governed by the provisions of the Pricing Page on the Plan chosen by the Customer. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Free Plan, such Plan shall run for an indefinite period and may be terminated by either party with immediate effect.\n\n    2. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Paid Plan, such Plan shall run for one month and may be terminated by either party with effect as of the end of the month. If the Paid Plan is not terminated, it is automatically renewed for one further month; for such renewed period, the provisions of the Pricing Page applicable to the Customer before renewal continue to apply.\n\n    3. The Parties’ statutory right to extraordinary termination remains unaffected. An important reason is present for the other contracting party in particular if:\n\n        1. one of the Parties seriously breaches its obligations under the Contract and the other Party can no longer reasonably be expected to abide by the Contract;\n\n        2. the Customer is more than two (2) months in arrears with the payment of due fees or other remuneration, even after the expiry of a reasonable period set by Pitch to remedy the situation;\n\n        3. insolvency proceedings are applied for, instituted or dismissed in respect of all or part of the assets of a Party;\n\n        4. one of the Parties has a reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 Insolvency Statute (*Insolvenzordnung*, “**InsO**”); or\n\n        5. the financial circumstances of a Party deteriorate to such an extent that proper performance of the Contract can no longer be expected, even if there is no reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 InsO.\n\n    4. Each termination must be made by declaration in text form.\n\n19. ### Secrecy\n\n    1. The Parties undertake to maintain temporally unlimited secrecy regarding all confidential information which they will obtain or have already obtained in the context of the contractual relation and not to disclose or otherwise use such information, unless necessary to perform the Contract. Confidential information are all information and documents of the Parties labeled as confidential or to be considered confidential based on the circumstances, particularly information concerning operating routines, business relations, further business or trade secrets, know-how, all work results as well as the business model of Pitch.\n\n    2. Exempt from this obligation shall be confidential information:\n\n        1. that can be demonstrated to have already been known to the other Party upon initiation of the Contract or become known thereafter through third Parties without any breach of a confidentiality agreement, of statutory provisions, or of administrative orders;\n\n        2. that was known to the general public, unless this was due to a breach of this Contract;\n\n        3. that had to be disclosed based on statutory obligations on the order of a court or authority. As permissible and feasible, the Party obliged to disclosure shall inform the other Party in such event in advance, providing it with the opportunity to take action against the disclosure.\n\n    3. Any disclosure of confidential information to third Parties shall require the express written approval of the other Party, unless otherwise expressly agreed.\n\n    4. The Parties shall ensure through suitable contractual arrangements that the employees and contractors working for them shall also, without temporal restriction, refrain from individual use or disclosure of confidential information. The Parties shall only disclose to employees or contractors confidential information to the extent such employees or contractors need to know the information for the fulfilment of the Contract.\n\n    5. The Customer consents for Pitch to disclose the collaboration between Pitch and the Customer for marketing purposes and in this connection also use the company logo of the Customer. The Customer may revoke this consent pursuant to this Section 18.5 at any time by declaration in text form (e.g. via e-mail to [privacy@pitch.io](mailto:privacy@pitch.io)).\n\n20. ### Data Protection\n\n    1. Pitch treats the Customer's personal data in accordance with data protection standards and specifications.\n\n    2. Pitch acts as a data processor within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR vis-à-vis such customers that feed personal data (*personenbezogene Daten*) of their customers into the Software. As part of the online registration process, the Parties conclude a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. A completion of the online registration process is not possible without the conclusion of the data processing agreement.\n\n21. ### Final Provisions\n\n    1. The following only applies to customers which legally qualify as businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code: Should individual provisions of the Contract of use or other contractual documents be or become invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or should they not contain a necessary provision, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid or unenforceable provision or to fill the loophole, the legally admissible provision shall be deemed to have been agreed retroactively which corresponds as closely as possible to what the Parties would have wished or would have been agreed in spirit and purpose by the Parties if they had considered the invalidity or unenforceability of the provision in question or the loophole.\n\n    2. If these ToU refer to a written form or notification, the sending of an e-mail shall also suffice respectively.\n\n    3. The Contract and the other contract documents are subject to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the German conflict of laws principles and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Statutory provisions on the restriction of choice of law and the applicability of mandatory law in particular of the place where a customer which legally qualifies as consumer (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code has its habitual residence (*gewöhnlicher Aufenthalt*) remain unaffected.\n\n    4. Vis-à-vis customers that qualify as merchant (*Kaufmann*), legal entity under public law (*juristische Person des öffentlichen Rechts*) or separate fund under public law (*öffentlich-rechtliches Sondervermögen*), for all disputes arising from or in connection with the Contract or the ToU, including their validity, the District Court of Berlin (*Landgericht Berlin*) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to the extent permitted by law.\n\n    5. The European Commission provides a platform for an online settlement of disputes which can be accessed under [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). Pitch is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions before a consumer dispute settlement commission nor will it do so voluntarily.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":false,"title":"Terms of Use","version":"1.1.1","date":"2023-11-14","customSlug":"/terms-of-use","excerpt":"\nPitch Software GmbH","slug":"/terms-of-use/v1-1-1","content":"\n## Pitch Software GmbH\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"long-list\"\u003e\n\n1. ### Scope of Application and General Provisions\n\n    1. These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as \"**ToU**\") apply to the provision and use of Pitch’s cross-platform Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (hereinafter referred to as \"**Software**\", substantiated in Section 3.2) by Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (hereinafter referred to as \"**Pitch**\"). Free services offered by Pitch address both consumers (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code, and businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code. Paid Plans (as defined in Section 3.2) are offered exclusively to companies or persons that legally qualify as entrepreneurs (*Unternehmer*) (the respective customer hereinafter referred to as \"**Customer**\", together with Pitch the \"**Parties**\").\n\n    2. For the avoidance of doubt: The Customer is a consumer (*Verbraucher*) insofar as the purpose of the subscribed services is predominantly outside his trade, business or profession. On the other hand, an entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) is any natural or legal person or partnership with a legal personality who or which, when concluding the Contract, acts in the exercise of its trade, business or profession.\n\n    3. Deviations from these ToU shall only be considered agreed if they have expressly been confirmed in writing by Pitch. In particular, the mere omission of an objection by Pitch against any general terms and conditions of the Customer shall not cause such terms and conditions to be considered agreed. This shall also apply if Pitch performs Services unconditionally upon knowledge of opposing terms and conditions of the Customer or terms and conditions diverging from these ToU.\n\n    4. For important reasons, in particular in the event of changes to statutory provisions, judicial precedents, the Software or market conditions, Pitch may notify the Customer of amendments to these ToU. The amended ToU shall be deemed to have been agreed if the Customer has not objected to the amendment within one month upon receipt of the notification and Pitch has explicitly notified the Customer of this consequence. Regardless of the foregoing, changes to the scope of the Contractual Service (*Umfang der geschuldeten Leistungen)* require the express consent of the Customer.\n\n2. ### Conclusion of Contract\n\n    1. To access the Service, the Customer must first select a supported login method to start the signup process. Subsequently, by checking the respective boxes, the Customer accepts the then current versions of Pitch’s ToU, privacy policy ([https://pitch.com/privacy-policy](https://pitch.com/privacy-policy)), and data processing agreement ([https://pitch.com/dpa](https://pitch.com/dpa)). By clicking the corresponding button and proceeding with the sign up process, the Customer accepts Pitch's offer to conclude a contract (the \"**Contract**\") including these ToU. Upon completion of the signup process, a workspace is created to which the Customer can invite other users (each user a \"**Workspace Member**\") to collaborate on presentations.\n\n    2. In subscribing to a Paid Plan, the Customer, acting as a Admin or Workspace Owner, guarantees that they act in the capacity as entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code (*Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch*, BGB) and warrant that they are legally authorized to represent the entity they are acting on behalf of and bind the entity to these Terms of Use.\n\n3. ### Scope of Services\n\n    1. The Software is a cross-platform SaaS application for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (the \"**Contract Purpose**\"). The provision of the Software shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"**Service**\".\n\n    2. Pitch may offer free plans (each a \"**Free Plan**\") and paid plans (each a \"**Paid Plan**\") for the subscription to the Service. The individually agreed scope of Service of the Contract between the Customer and Pitch shall be based on the respective Free Plan or Paid Plan as described on the Pricing Page and selected by the Customer (such selected plan the \"**Plan**\"). The Service owed by Pitch according to the contractually agreed scope of Service shall hereinafter be referred to as \"**Contractual Services**\"; the term \"**Software**\" shall only include those parts of the Software which are covered by the contractually agreed scope of services.\n\n    3. Pitch reserves the right to remove certain features from the Free Plans at its own discretion.\n\n    4. Upon completion of the signup process, the Customer may add and remove other users to the workspace. On a Free Plan, adding additional users is free of charge. On a Paid Plan, adding additional users may incur cost as per the Pricing Page. Each paying user in a workspace is referred to as a \"**Paid Seat**\".\n\n    5. The Customer may upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan, or switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan at any time; in this case, from the time of the switch the details concerning the scope of services, remuneration, etc. of the new Plan stated on the Pricing Page shall apply. A switch to a cheaper Plan is only permissible with the consent of Pitch or if the notice period specified in these ToU or on the Pricing Page is observed.\n\n    6. The Customer may at any time decrease or increase the number of Paid Seats. Decreasing or increasing the number of Paid Seats does not affect the term or terminability of the Customer’s Plan. In case of increase, the cost for each increase is subject to the provisions of the applicable Pricing Page and is calculated on a pro-rated basis under consideration of the billing period of the Customer’s Plan. In case of decrease, the compensation owed by the Customer under his Plan proportionately decreases with effect as of the next billing period of his Plan.\n\n4. ### Use of the Software by the Customer\n\n    1. The Software is used by means of telecommunications via the browser or a stand-alone application.\n\n    2. The Customer may only use the access to the Software itself and for the contractually agreed purpose.\n\n    3. The Customer undertakes to take appropriate security precautions to ensure that access to the Software is not used by unauthorised persons. Such security precautions include in particular the use of a secure password, not sharing user credentials with other individuals and Workspaces. \n\n    4. The Customer may only enter data, texts, pictures and other content (including custom fonts) into the Software\n\n        1. that comply with applicable law;\n\n        2. that do not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the entering of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the content uploaded by the Customer for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it available for retrieval.\n\n        Pitch is entitled to delete content uploaded by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not entered into the Software in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    5. Content included in the Software, in particular pictures, graphics and/or fonts, may only be used for the purposes of this Contract.\n\n    6. The Customer agrees not to upload, transmit, support, incite, promote or otherwise make available any content that is or could reasonably be viewed as unlawful, racist, hostile, violent, discriminatory (including relating to race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin), harmful, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable or which contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.\n\n    7. The Customer indemnifies and holds Pitch harmless from all claims by third parties (in particular from claims arising out of breach of copyright, competition, trademark or data protection law) that are asserted against Pitch in connection with the Customer’s use of the Software insofar as such claims do not result from wilful or grossly negligent behaviour of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen)*. This indemnification obligation comprises the reimbursement for appropriate costs that Pitch incurred in the course of asserting or defending its legal rights in this context.\n\n6. ### Availability\n\n    1. Pitch shall not be responsible for establishing and maintaining the data link between the Customer's IT systems and the Transfer Point. \"**Transfer Point**\" shall mean the router exit of the Pitch data centre or its subcontractor's data centre through whose server the Software is operated. Pitch is not responsible for malfunctions beyond the Transfer Point. The Customer is responsible for the procurement and maintenance of the necessary hardware and connections to public telecommunications networks. The costs of setting up the online connection and maintaining it on the Customer's side shall be borne by the Customer. Pitch is not liable for the security, confidentiality or integrity of the data communication, which is conducted via third party communication networks. Pitch is also not liable for malfunctions in data transmission caused by technical errors or configuration problems on the part of the Customer.\n\n    2. The Software availability owed by Pitch depends on the Plan chosen by the Customer and is specified on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any regulations, the following applies: If the Customer has chosen a Free Plan, Pitch does not owe any availability. If the Customer has chosen a Paid Plan, Pitch shall owe an Availability of at least 99% in the Contract's yearly average.\n\n    3. Pitch strives to provide the Customer with the best possible customer experience. However, contractually, Pitch does not owe the comprehensive error-free operation and usability of the Software. Pitch only owes that the Customer can use the Software for the Contract Purpose at the level of Availability as set out in Section 5.2. \"**Availability**\" means that the Customer can access and use the main features of the Software. Times during which the Software is not available due to an error or other reasons are considered \"**Downtime**\".\n\n    4. For determining the Availability, such Downtime is not taken into account\n\n        1. in which the Software cannot be reached due to technical or other problems for which Pitch is not responsible (force majeure, third-party fault, errors in the IT systems of the Customer or the third party service providers acting on his behalf, etc.);\n\n        2. which is due to a breach of the Customer's obligation to cooperate, in particular to a delayed or incomplete transmission of an error message; or\n\n        3. which is used for normal maintenance work of up to five hours a month.\n\n7. ### Software Operation and Changes\n\n    1. Pitch intends to use state-of-the-art technology and shall be entitled to regularly carry out or introduce updates, new versions or upgrades of the Software (hereinafter referred to uniformly as “**Updates**”) in order to adapt the Software to new technical or commercial requirements, to implement new features, or to make changes to existing features in order to improve the Software.\n\n    2. If and insofar as the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose is materially impaired by an Update (such an Update a “**Material Change”**), Pitch shall inform the Customer in text form of the introduction of the Material Change at least four weeks prior to it becoming effective (a “**Change Notice**”). If the Customer does not object to the Material Change within two weeks after receipt of the Change Notice in text form (the “**Objection Notice**”), the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. With each Change Notice, Pitch shall inform the Customer of the Customer’s rights pursuant to this Section 6.2, in particular: (i) the objection right, (ii) the period foreseen for objection and (iii) the legal consequences of not declaring an objection to the Material Change in time.\n\n    3. If the Customer objects to the Material Change, Pitch shall further provide the Software for use to the Customer without the Material Change unless this is impossible for technical or organizational reasons or Pitch cannot reasonably be expected to do so. In the latter case, the Customer is entitled to terminate the Contract extraordinarily for good cause within four weeks (the “**Exercise Period**”). If the Customer does not make use of its termination right, the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. The Exercise Period shall commence as soon as Pitch has informed the Customer in text form of (i) the non-continuability of the Contract without the Material Change, (ii) the Customer’s extraordinary termination right and (iii) the legal consequences of the expiry of the Exercise Period.\n\n8. ### Publication of Content on pitch.com\n\n    1. The Customer may have the option to make presentations created by the Customer, including data, text, pictures and other content (the \"**Customer Content**\"), publicly accessible via the pitch.com platform (the \"pitch.com Platform\").\n\n    2. The Customer may only publish Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform\n\n        1. that complies with applicable law;\n\n        2. that does not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the publishing of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the Customer Content for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it accessible via the pitch.com Platform.\n\n        Pitch does not review the Customer Content before publishing. Pitch is entitled to delete content published by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not published in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    3. The provisions in Section 4.6 and 4.7 apply to the publication of Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform accordingly.\n\n9. ### Compensation and Terms of Payment\n\n    1. The compensation for the use of the Software by the Customer and the respective terms of payment shall be based on the Pricing Page shown to the Customer in the purchase flow, available at [app.pitch.com/app/pricing/](https://app.pitch.com/app/pricing/). The Contract is governed by the current version of the Pricing Page at the time the Contract is concluded or the switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan or the upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan according to Section 3.5 is performed (in the applicable version of the \"**Pricing Page**\"). In case of renewal of a Paid Plan according to Section 17.2, the version of the pricing page applicable to the Customer does not change but remains the same, unless a price change has been introduced according to 8.4..\n\n    2. All fees and prices indicated by Pitch are net prices without taxes (e.g. VAT), non-cancelable and non-refundable. The Customer shall be responsible for payment of all taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder. The payment period depends on the Paid Plan chosen by the Customer and as set out on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment period, the compensation is to be paid monthly in advance upon receipt of the respective invoice issued by Pitch. Invoices are sent by Pitch to the Customer via email.\n\n    3. The available payment options are detailed on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment options, payments can be made via credit card.\n\n    4. Pitch is entitled to adjust its net prices to compensate personnel cost or other cost increases annually in an appropriate amount. Pitch will announce these price adjustments and the effective date of the price adjustments to the customer in text form. The price adjustments shall not apply to the periods the Customer has already paid for. If the price increase is more than 5% of the previous price, the Customer may object to this net price increase within a period of two weeks from notification. A change in the price resulting from a change in the scope of features or the number of employees to be administered shall not be deemed a price adjustment within the meaning of this section 8.4.\n\n\n10. ### Warranty for Material and Legal Defects\n\n    1. Pitch warrants that the Software corresponds to the agreed scope of Service when used in accordance with the Contract and that it is not encumbered with material or legal defects (\"**Defects**\") which more than insignificantly impair the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose. Immaterial deviations shall not be considered as Defects.\n\n    2. The Customer shall be obliged to communicate any Defect to Pitch immediately upon appearance. Pitch shall remedy any duly notified Defects appearing in the Software within a reasonable period of time.\n\n11. ### Liability\n\n    1. The no-fault based liability pursuant to Section 536a(1) German Civil Code for Defects in the Software existing at the time of contracting shall be excluded, unless the Defect relates to a feature of the Software essential for the Contract Purpose.\n\n    2. Pitch is liable for damages if arising from (i) willful misconduct or gross negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen*), (ii) negligent violation of a material contractual duty (*Kardinalpflichten*) by Pitch or its legal representatives or agents, however, limited to typical damages which are foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the Contract or (iii) negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents in a way causing injury to life, body or health, or (iv) any compulsory statutory liability of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents. Material contractual duties (*Kardinalspflichten*) are duties the fulfillment of which is a prerequisite for proper execution of the Contract or the breach of which endangers attainment of the Contract Purpose and the observance of which the Customer must regularly rely on.\n\n    3. Any contributory negligence on the part of the Customer shall be taken into account. In particular, Pitch shall only be liable for the recovery of data if the Customer has taken all necessary and reasonable data backup precautions and ensured that the data can be recovered at reasonable cost from data material kept in machine-readable form.\n\n    4. This liability arrangement is conclusive. It shall apply with respect to all damage compensation claims, irrespective of their legal ground, particularly also with respect to pre-contractual claims or collateral contractual claims. This liability arrangement shall also apply in favor of legal representatives and agents of Pitch if claims are asserted directly against them.\n\n    5. The Customer is obliged to immediately notify any damage pursuant to the above liability provisions to Pitch in text form or to have such damage documented by Pitch, so that Pitch is informed as early as possible and can possibly still mitigate the damage together with the Customer.\n\n12. ### Non-contractual Use, Damages\n\n    1. For each case in which a Contractual Service is used unauthorisedly under the responsibility of the Customer, the Customer shall pay damages in the amount of the compensation that would have been due for the contractual use under the minimum contract period applicable to this Service. The Customer reserves the right to prove that the Customer is not responsible for the unauthorised use or that there is no damage or considerably less damage.\n\n    2. Pitch remains entitled to claim further damages.\n\n13. ### Limitation of Claims\n\n    1. Claims of the Customer based on the breach of any duty not consisting of a Defect become time-barred, except in the event of intention or gross negligence, within one year from beginning of the limitation period. This shall not apply if the damage in question incurred by the Customer consists in personal injury. Claims for personal injury become statute-barred within the statutory limitation period.\n\n    2. Any rescission of contract or reduction of payments shall be invalid if the claim to performance or subsequent performance of the Customer has become time-barred.\n\n14. ### Copyright and License\n\n    1. The Software is protected by copyright. Pitch represents that the general operation of the Software is permitted by law, does not violate any statutes, regulations or directives and, in particular, does not infringe on any third party rights. Pitch undertakes to indemnify the Customer against legitimate third party claims due to the operation of the Software and to compensate the Customer for any damage incurred in this context (including reasonable costs of legal defense) in accordance with Section 10.\n\n    2. The Customer shall have the non-transferrable, non-exclusive right, temporally restricted to the term of the Contract, to use the Service via the Internet for the contractual purpose agreed under the Contract. The Customer shall not obtain any rights beyond this. In particular, the Customer is not entitled to make the Software accessible to third Parties or to use them in any other way outside the purpose of the Contract. In particular, the Customer has to refrain from copying, decompiling, reverse engineering or editing the Service beyond the Contract Purpose.\n\n    3. The Software includes open source software provided by third parties (see list [here](https://c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953.try.pitch.com/c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953/third-party-notices.html)).\n\n15. ### Feedback\n\n    The Customer agrees that Pitch may freely use, exploit and further develop any feedback provided by the Customer.\n\n16. ### Purchase of Rights to Third Party Content\n\n    1. The Service may include the possibility of the Customer to acquire the right to use, reproduce, copy or disseminate content (e.g. pictures or videos) owned or licensed by third parties (“**Third Party Content**”). In this case, Pitch acts as a reseller of the entity or person owning or licensing the Third Party Content.\n\n    2. The compensation, payment conditions and other provisions regarding the purchase of Third Party Content by the Customer via the Software as well as the scope of the rights of use shall be governed by the provisions contained on the Pricing Page applicable at the time of the respective purchase. If the Pricing Page contains no provisions, the Parties will conclude a separate agreement thereon.\n\n17. ### Set-off, Reduction, Retention\n\n    1. The Customer shall only have a right of set-off, reduction and/or retention against Pitch if its counterclaim has been legally established, undisputed or acknowledged by Pitch.\n\n    2. Furthermore, the Customer may only exercise a right of retention if the counterclaim is based on the same contractual relationship.\n\n    3. The Customer's right to reclaim remuneration not actually owed shall remain unaffected by the limitation of Section 16.1.\n\n18. ### Term and Termination\n\n    1. The term of the Contract and terminability shall be governed by the provisions of the Pricing Page on the Plan chosen by the Customer. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Free Plan, such Plan shall run for an indefinite period and may be terminated by either party with immediate effect.\n\n    2. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Paid Plan, such Plan shall run for one month and may be terminated by either party with effect as of the end of the month. If the Paid Plan is not terminated, it is automatically renewed for one further month; for such renewed period, the provisions of the Pricing Page applicable to the Customer at renewal date shall apply.\n\n    3. The Parties’ statutory right to extraordinary termination remains unaffected. An important reason is present for the other contracting party in particular if:\n\n        1. one of the Parties seriously breaches its obligations under the Contract and the other Party can no longer reasonably be expected to abide by the Contract;\n\n        2. the Customer is more than one (1) month in arrears with the payment of due fees or other remuneration, even after the expiry of a reasonable period set by Pitch to remedy the situation;\n\n        3. insolvency proceedings are applied for, instituted or dismissed in respect of all or part of the assets of a Party;\n\n        4. one of the Parties has a reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 Insolvency Statute (*Insolvenzordnung*, \"**InsO**\"); or\n\n        5. the financial circumstances of a Party deteriorate to such an extent that proper performance of the Contract can no longer be expected, even if there is no reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 InsO.\n\n    4. Each termination must be made by declaration in text form.  If the Contract is canceled or terminated by any party, any unused credits will expire immediately and can neither be refunded nor used for a future Contract.\n\n19. ### Secrecy\n\n    1. The Parties undertake to maintain temporally unlimited secrecy regarding all confidential information which they will obtain or have already obtained in the context of the contractual relation and not to disclose or otherwise use such information, unless necessary to perform the Contract. Confidential information are all information and documents of the Parties labeled as confidential or to be considered confidential based on the circumstances, particularly information concerning operating routines, business relations, further business or trade secrets, know-how, all work results, the business model of Pitch, as well as features to which Customers may have early access for testing purposes.\n\n    2. Exempt from this obligation shall be confidential information:\n\n        1. that can be demonstrated to have already been known to the other Party upon initiation of the Contract or become known thereafter through third Parties without any breach of a confidentiality agreement, of statutory provisions, or of administrative orders;\n\n        2. that was known to the general public, unless this was due to a breach of this Contract;\n\n        3. that had to be disclosed based on statutory obligations on the order of a court or authority. As permissible and feasible, the Party obliged to disclosure shall inform the other Party in such event in advance, providing it with the opportunity to take action against the disclosure.\n\n    3. Any disclosure of confidential information to third Parties shall require the express written approval of the other Party, unless otherwise expressly agreed.\n\n    4. The Parties shall ensure through suitable contractual arrangements that the employees and contractors working for them shall also, without temporal restriction, refrain from individual use or disclosure of confidential information. The Parties shall only disclose to employees or contractors confidential information to the extent such employees or contractors need to know the information for the fulfillment of the Contract.\n\n    5. The Customer consents for Pitch to disclose the collaboration between Pitch and the Customer in marketing materials for marketing purposes and in this connection also use the company logo of the Customer. The Customer may revoke this consent pursuant to this Section 18.5 at any time by declaration in text form (e.g. via e-mail to [privacy@pitch.io](mailto:privacy@pitch.io)).\n\n20. ### Data Protection\n\n    1. Pitch treats the Customer's personal data in accordance with data protection standards and specifications.\n\n    2. Pitch acts as a data processor within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR vis-à-vis such customers that feed personal data (*personenbezogene Daten*) of their customers into the Software. As part of the online registration process, the Parties conclude a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. A completion of the online registration process is not possible without the conclusion of the data processing agreement.\n\n21. ### Final Provisions\n\n    1. The following only applies to customers which legally qualify as businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code: Should individual provisions of the Contract of use or other contractual documents be or become invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or should they not contain a necessary provision, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid or unenforceable provision or to fill the loophole, the legally admissible provision shall be deemed to have been agreed retroactively which corresponds as closely as possible to what the Parties would have wished or would have been agreed in spirit and purpose by the Parties if they had considered the invalidity or unenforceability of the provision in question or the loophole.\n\n    2. If these ToU refer to a written form or notification, the sending of an e-mail shall also suffice respectively.\n\n    3. The Contract and the other contract documents are subject to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the German conflict of laws principles and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Statutory provisions on the restriction of choice of law and the applicability of mandatory law in particular of the place where a customer which legally qualifies as consumer (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code has its habitual residence (*gewöhnlicher Aufenthalt*) remain unaffected.\n\n    4. Vis-à-vis customers that qualify as merchant (*Kaufmann*), legal entity under public law (*juristische Person des öffentlichen Rechts*) or separate fund under public law (*öffentlich-rechtliches Sondervermögen*), for all disputes arising from or in connection with the Contract or the ToU, including their validity, the District Court of Berlin (*Landgericht Berlin*) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to the extent permitted by law.\n\n    5. The European Commission provides a platform for an online settlement of disputes which can be accessed under [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). Pitch is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions before a consumer dispute settlement commission nor will it do so voluntarily.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},{"type":"legal-article","isIndexed":false,"title":"Terms of Use","version":"1.1.2","date":"2024-11-19","customSlug":"/terms-of-use","excerpt":"\nPitch Software GmbH","slug":"/terms-of-use","content":"\n## Pitch Software GmbH\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"long-list\"\u003e\n\n1. ### Scope of Application and General Provisions\n\n    1. These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as \"**ToU**\") apply to the provision and use of Pitch’s cross-platform Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (hereinafter referred to as \"**Software**\", substantiated in Section 3.2) by Pitch Software GmbH, Joachimstraße 7, 10119 Berlin (hereinafter referred to as \"**Pitch**\"). Free services offered by Pitch address both consumers (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code, and businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code. Paid Plans (as defined in Section 3.2) are offered exclusively to companies or persons that legally qualify as entrepreneurs (*Unternehmer*) (the respective customer hereinafter referred to as \"**Customer**\", together with Pitch the \"**Parties**\").\n\n    2. For the avoidance of doubt: The Customer is a consumer (*Verbraucher*) insofar as the purpose of the subscribed services is predominantly outside his trade, business or profession. On the other hand, an entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) is any natural or legal person or partnership with a legal personality who or which, when concluding the Contract, acts in the exercise of its trade, business or profession.\n\n    3. Deviations from these ToU shall only be considered agreed if they have expressly been confirmed in writing by Pitch. In particular, the mere omission of an objection by Pitch against any general terms and conditions of the Customer shall not cause such terms and conditions to be considered agreed. This shall also apply if Pitch performs Services unconditionally upon knowledge of opposing terms and conditions of the Customer or terms and conditions diverging from these ToU.\n\n    4. For important reasons, in particular in the event of changes to statutory provisions, judicial precedents, the Software or market conditions, Pitch may notify the Customer of amendments to these ToU. The amended ToU shall be deemed to have been agreed if the Customer has not objected to the amendment within one month upon receipt of the notification and Pitch has explicitly notified the Customer of this consequence. Regardless of the foregoing, changes to the scope of the Contractual Service (*Umfang der geschuldeten Leistungen)* require the express consent of the Customer.\n\n2. ### Conclusion of Contract\n\n    1. To access the Service, the Customer must first select a supported login method to start the signup process. Subsequently, by checking the respective boxes, the Customer accepts the then current versions of Pitch’s ToU, privacy policy ([https://pitch.com/privacy-policy](https://pitch.com/privacy-policy)), and data processing agreement ([https://pitch.com/dpa](https://pitch.com/dpa)). By clicking the corresponding button and proceeding with the sign up process, the Customer accepts Pitch's offer to conclude a contract (the \"**Contract**\") including these ToU. Upon completion of the signup process, a workspace is created to which the Customer can invite other users (each user a \"**Workspace Member**\") to collaborate on presentations.\n\n    2. In subscribing to a Paid Plan, the Customer, acting as a Admin or Workspace Owner, guarantees that they act in the capacity as entrepreneur (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code (*Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch*, BGB) and warrant that they are legally authorized to represent the entity they are acting on behalf of and bind the entity to these Terms of Use.\n\n3. ### Scope of Services\n\n    1. The Software is a cross-platform SaaS application for collaboratively creating, editing, and sharing presentations (the \"**Contract Purpose**\"). The provision of the Software shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"**Service**\".\n\n    2. Pitch may offer free plans (each a \"**Free Plan**\") and paid plans (each a \"**Paid Plan**\") for the subscription to the Service. The individually agreed scope of Service of the Contract between the Customer and Pitch shall be based on the respective Free Plan or Paid Plan as described on the Pricing Page and selected by the Customer (such selected plan the \"**Plan**\"). The Service owed by Pitch according to the contractually agreed scope of Service shall hereinafter be referred to as \"**Contractual Services**\"; the term \"**Software**\" shall only include those parts of the Software which are covered by the contractually agreed scope of services.\n\n    3. Pitch reserves the right to remove certain features from the Free Plans at its own discretion.\n\n    4. Upon completion of the signup process, the Customer may add and remove other users to the workspace. On a Free Plan, adding additional users is free of charge. On a Paid Plan, adding additional users may incur cost as per the Pricing Page. Each paying user in a workspace is referred to as a \"**Paid Seat**\".\n\n    5. The Customer may upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan, or switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan at any time; in this case, from the time of the switch the details concerning the scope of services, remuneration, etc. of the new Plan stated on the Pricing Page shall apply. A switch to a cheaper Plan is only permissible with the consent of Pitch or if the notice period specified in these ToU or on the Pricing Page is observed.\n\n    6. The Customer may at any time decrease or increase the number of Paid Seats. Decreasing or increasing the number of Paid Seats does not affect the term or terminability of the Customer’s Plan. In case of increase, the cost for each increase is subject to the provisions of the applicable Pricing Page and is calculated on a pro-rated basis under consideration of the billing period of the Customer’s Plan. In case of decrease, the compensation owed by the Customer under his Plan proportionately decreases with effect as of the next billing period of his Plan.\n\n4. ### Use of the Software by the Customer\n\n    1. The Software is used by means of telecommunications via the browser or a stand-alone application.\n\n    2. The Customer may only use the access to the Software itself and for the contractually agreed purpose.\n\n    3. The Customer undertakes to take appropriate security precautions to ensure that access to the Software is not used by unauthorised persons. Such security precautions include in particular the use of a secure password, not sharing user credentials with other individuals and Workspaces. \n\n    4. The Customer may only enter data, texts, pictures and other content (including custom fonts) into the Software\n\n        1. that comply with applicable law;\n\n        2. that do not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the entering of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the content uploaded by the Customer for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it available for retrieval.\n\n        Pitch is entitled to delete content uploaded by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not entered into the Software in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    5. Content included in the Software, in particular pictures, graphics and/or fonts, may only be used for the purposes of this Contract.\n\n    6. The Customer agrees not to upload, transmit, support, incite, promote or otherwise make available any content that is or could reasonably be viewed as unlawful, racist, hostile, violent, discriminatory (including relating to race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin), harmful, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable or which contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.\n\n    7. The Customer indemnifies and holds Pitch harmless from all claims by third parties (in particular from claims arising out of breach of copyright, competition, trademark or data protection law) that are asserted against Pitch in connection with the Customer’s use of the Software insofar as such claims do not result from wilful or grossly negligent behaviour of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen)*. This indemnification obligation comprises the reimbursement for appropriate costs that Pitch incurred in the course of asserting or defending its legal rights in this context.\n\n5. ### Availability\n\n    1. Pitch shall not be responsible for establishing and maintaining the data link between the Customer's IT systems and the Transfer Point. \"**Transfer Point**\" shall mean the router exit of the Pitch data centre or its subcontractor's data centre through whose server the Software is operated. Pitch is not responsible for malfunctions beyond the Transfer Point. The Customer is responsible for the procurement and maintenance of the necessary hardware and connections to public telecommunications networks. The costs of setting up the online connection and maintaining it on the Customer's side shall be borne by the Customer. Pitch is not liable for the security, confidentiality or integrity of the data communication, which is conducted via third party communication networks. Pitch is also not liable for malfunctions in data transmission caused by technical errors or configuration problems on the part of the Customer.\n\n    2. The Software availability owed by Pitch depends on the Plan chosen by the Customer and is specified on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any regulations, the following applies: If the Customer has chosen a Free Plan, Pitch does not owe any availability. If the Customer has chosen a Paid Plan, Pitch shall owe an Availability of at least 99% in the Contract's yearly average.\n\n    3. Pitch strives to provide the Customer with the best possible customer experience. However, contractually, Pitch does not owe the comprehensive error-free operation and usability of the Software. Pitch only owes that the Customer can use the Software for the Contract Purpose at the level of Availability as set out in Section 5.2. \"**Availability**\" means that the Customer can access and use the main features of the Software. Times during which the Software is not available due to an error or other reasons are considered \"**Downtime**\".\n\n    4. For determining the Availability, such Downtime is not taken into account\n\n        1. in which the Software cannot be reached due to technical or other problems for which Pitch is not responsible (force majeure, third-party fault, errors in the IT systems of the Customer or the third party service providers acting on his behalf, etc.);\n\n        2. which is due to a breach of the Customer's obligation to cooperate, in particular to a delayed or incomplete transmission of an error message; or\n\n        3. which is used for normal maintenance work of up to five hours a month.\n\n6. ### Software Operation and Changes\n\n    1. Pitch intends to use state-of-the-art technology and shall be entitled to regularly carry out or introduce updates, new versions or upgrades of the Software (hereinafter referred to uniformly as “**Updates**”) in order to adapt the Software to new technical or commercial requirements, to implement new features, or to make changes to existing features in order to improve the Software.\n\n    2. If and insofar as the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose is materially impaired by an Update (such an Update a “**Material Change”**), Pitch shall inform the Customer in text form of the introduction of the Material Change at least four weeks prior to it becoming effective (a “**Change Notice**”). If the Customer does not object to the Material Change within two weeks after receipt of the Change Notice in text form (the “**Objection Notice**”), the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. With each Change Notice, Pitch shall inform the Customer of the Customer’s rights pursuant to this Section 6.2, in particular: (i) the objection right, (ii) the period foreseen for objection and (iii) the legal consequences of not declaring an objection to the Material Change in time.\n\n    3. If the Customer objects to the Material Change, Pitch shall further provide the Software for use to the Customer without the Material Change unless this is impossible for technical or organizational reasons or Pitch cannot reasonably be expected to do so. In the latter case, the Customer is entitled to terminate the Contract extraordinarily for good cause within four weeks (the “**Exercise Period**”). If the Customer does not make use of its termination right, the Material Change shall become an integral component of the Contract. The Exercise Period shall commence as soon as Pitch has informed the Customer in text form of (i) the non-continuability of the Contract without the Material Change, (ii) the Customer’s extraordinary termination right and (iii) the legal consequences of the expiry of the Exercise Period.\n\n7. ### Publication of Content on pitch.com and on Custom Domains\n\n    1. The Customer may have the option to make presentations created by the Customer, including data, text, pictures and other content (the \"**Customer Content**\"), publicly accessible via the pitch.com platform (the \"pitch.com Platform\").\n\n    2. The Customer may only publish Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform\n\n        1. that complies with applicable law;\n\n        2. that does not infringe third party rights; and\n\n        3. to the publishing of which the Customer is legally entitled without any restrictions.\n\n        The Customer agrees that Pitch may process the Customer Content for the purposes of this Contract, in particular store such content and make it accessible via the pitch.com Platform.\n\n        Pitch does not review the Customer Content before publishing. Pitch is entitled to delete content published by the Customer if reasonable grounds exist for Pitch to assume that the content was not published in compliance with the provisions of these ToU.\n\n    3. The provisions in Section 4.6 and 4.7 apply to the publication of Customer Content on the pitch.com Platform and the display of presentations on a custom domain accordingly.\n\n    4.  Pitch enables the Customer to display presentations on a custom domain, which the Customer is solely responsible for managing. Pitch acts solely as a technical provider and does not control, monitor, or endorse the content displayed on the custom domain.\n\n    5. The use of Pitch's custom domain services is subject to the policies of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (https://icann.org⁠) (“ICANN”). The Customer agrees to comply with ICANN’s requirements, standards, policies, procedures, and practices.\n\n    6. The renewal of the custom domain is the Customer's responsibility and Pitch cannot be held liable for an unavailable or cancelled custom domain.\n\n    7. Pitch is not liable for any information or content displayed on the Customer's custom domain. The Customer is obliged to notify Pitch about any potential illegal content on the custom domain. Upon receiving a valid notification of illegal content, Pitch will review such a claim and may, at its discretion, without further notice restrict access to the custom domain until the issue is resolved.\n\n    8. The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that all content displayed on their custom domain complies with applicable laws. If the Customer becomes aware of any illegal content on their domain, they must promptly notify Pitch and take immediate steps to remove or correct the content.\n\n\n9. ### Compensation and Terms of Payment\n\n    1. The compensation for the use of the Software by the Customer and the respective terms of payment shall be based on the Pricing Page shown to the Customer in the purchase flow, available at [app.pitch.com/app/pricing/](https://app.pitch.com/app/pricing/). The Contract is governed by the current version of the Pricing Page at the time the Contract is concluded or the switch to a more comprehensive Paid Plan or the upgrade from a Free Plan to a Paid Plan according to Section 3.5 is performed (in the applicable version of the \"**Pricing Page**\"). In case of renewal of a Paid Plan according to Section 17.2, the version of the pricing page applicable to the Customer does not change but remains the same, unless a price change has been introduced according to 8.4..\n\n    2. All fees and prices indicated by Pitch are net prices without taxes (e.g. VAT), non-cancelable and non-refundable. The Customer shall be responsible for payment of all taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder. The payment period depends on the Paid Plan chosen by the Customer and as set out on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment period, the compensation is to be paid monthly in advance upon receipt of the respective invoice issued by Pitch. Invoices are sent by Pitch to the Customer via email.\n\n    3. The available payment options are detailed on the Pricing Page. If the Pricing Page does not contain any provisions on the payment options, payments can be made via credit card.\n\n    4. Pitch is entitled to adjust its net prices to compensate personnel cost or other cost increases annually in an appropriate amount. Pitch will announce these price adjustments and the effective date of the price adjustments to the customer in text form. The price adjustments shall not apply to the periods the Customer has already paid for. If the price increase is more than 5% of the previous price, the Customer may object to this net price increase within a period of two weeks from notification. A change in the price resulting from a change in the scope of features or the number of employees to be administered shall not be deemed a price adjustment within the meaning of this section 8.4.\n\n\n10. ### Warranty for Material and Legal Defects\n\n    1. Pitch warrants that the Software corresponds to the agreed scope of Service when used in accordance with the Contract and that it is not encumbered with material or legal defects (\"**Defects**\") which more than insignificantly impair the suitability of the Software for the Contract Purpose. Immaterial deviations shall not be considered as Defects.\n\n    2. The Customer shall be obliged to communicate any Defect to Pitch immediately upon appearance. Pitch shall remedy any duly notified Defects appearing in the Software within a reasonable period of time.\n\n11. ### Liability\n\n    1. The no-fault based liability pursuant to Section 536a(1) German Civil Code for Defects in the Software existing at the time of contracting shall be excluded, unless the Defect relates to a feature of the Software essential for the Contract Purpose.\n\n    2. Pitch is liable for damages if arising from (i) willful misconduct or gross negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents (*gesetzliche Vertreter oder Erfüllungsgehilfen*), (ii) negligent violation of a material contractual duty (*Kardinalpflichten*) by Pitch or its legal representatives or agents, however, limited to typical damages which are foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the Contract or (iii) negligence of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents in a way causing injury to life, body or health, or (iv) any compulsory statutory liability of Pitch or its legal representatives or agents. Material contractual duties (*Kardinalspflichten*) are duties the fulfillment of which is a prerequisite for proper execution of the Contract or the breach of which endangers attainment of the Contract Purpose and the observance of which the Customer must regularly rely on.\n\n    3. Any contributory negligence on the part of the Customer shall be taken into account. In particular, Pitch shall only be liable for the recovery of data if the Customer has taken all necessary and reasonable data backup precautions and ensured that the data can be recovered at reasonable cost from data material kept in machine-readable form.\n\n    4. This liability arrangement is conclusive. It shall apply with respect to all damage compensation claims, irrespective of their legal ground, particularly also with respect to pre-contractual claims or collateral contractual claims. This liability arrangement shall also apply in favor of legal representatives and agents of Pitch if claims are asserted directly against them.\n\n    5. The Customer is obliged to immediately notify any damage pursuant to the above liability provisions to Pitch in text form or to have such damage documented by Pitch, so that Pitch is informed as early as possible and can possibly still mitigate the damage together with the Customer.\n\n12. ### Non-contractual Use, Damages\n\n    1. For each case in which a Contractual Service is used unauthorisedly under the responsibility of the Customer, the Customer shall pay damages in the amount of the compensation that would have been due for the contractual use under the minimum contract period applicable to this Service. The Customer reserves the right to prove that the Customer is not responsible for the unauthorised use or that there is no damage or considerably less damage.\n\n    2. Pitch remains entitled to claim further damages.\n\n13. ### Limitation of Claims\n\n    1. Claims of the Customer based on the breach of any duty not consisting of a Defect become time-barred, except in the event of intention or gross negligence, within one year from beginning of the limitation period. This shall not apply if the damage in question incurred by the Customer consists in personal injury. Claims for personal injury become statute-barred within the statutory limitation period.\n\n    2. Any rescission of contract or reduction of payments shall be invalid if the claim to performance or subsequent performance of the Customer has become time-barred.\n\n14. ### Copyright and License\n\n    1. The Software is protected by copyright. Pitch represents that the general operation of the Software is permitted by law, does not violate any statutes, regulations or directives and, in particular, does not infringe on any third party rights. Pitch undertakes to indemnify the Customer against legitimate third party claims due to the operation of the Software and to compensate the Customer for any damage incurred in this context (including reasonable costs of legal defense) in accordance with Section 10.\n\n    2. The Customer shall have the non-transferrable, non-exclusive right, temporally restricted to the term of the Contract, to use the Service via the Internet for the contractual purpose agreed under the Contract. The Customer shall not obtain any rights beyond this. In particular, the Customer is not entitled to make the Software accessible to third Parties or to use them in any other way outside the purpose of the Contract. In particular, the Customer has to refrain from copying, decompiling, reverse engineering or editing the Service beyond the Contract Purpose.\n\n    3. The Software includes open source software provided by third parties (see list [here](https://c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953.try.pitch.com/c4c43654-4130-4c56-b962-c3972b000953/third-party-notices.html)).\n\n15. ### Feedback\n\n    The Customer agrees that Pitch may freely use, exploit and further develop any feedback provided by the Customer.\n\n16. ### Purchase of Rights to Third Party Content\n\n    1. The Service may include the possibility of the Customer to acquire the right to use, reproduce, copy or disseminate content (e.g. pictures or videos) owned or licensed by third parties (“**Third Party Content**”). In this case, Pitch acts as a reseller of the entity or person owning or licensing the Third Party Content.\n\n    2. The compensation, payment conditions and other provisions regarding the purchase of Third Party Content by the Customer via the Software as well as the scope of the rights of use shall be governed by the provisions contained on the Pricing Page applicable at the time of the respective purchase. If the Pricing Page contains no provisions, the Parties will conclude a separate agreement thereon.\n\n17. ### Set-off, Reduction, Retention\n\n    1. The Customer shall only have a right of set-off, reduction and/or retention against Pitch if its counterclaim has been legally established, undisputed or acknowledged by Pitch.\n\n    2. Furthermore, the Customer may only exercise a right of retention if the counterclaim is based on the same contractual relationship.\n\n    3. The Customer's right to reclaim remuneration not actually owed shall remain unaffected by the limitation of Section 16.1.\n\n18. ### Term and Termination\n\n    1. The term of the Contract and terminability shall be governed by the provisions of the Pricing Page on the Plan chosen by the Customer. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Free Plan, such Plan shall run for an indefinite period and may be terminated by either party with immediate effect.\n\n    2. If the Pricing Page does not contain any information on the term or terminability of a Paid Plan, such Plan shall run for one month and may be terminated by either party with effect as of the end of the month. If the Paid Plan is not terminated, it is automatically renewed for one further month; for such renewed period, the provisions of the Pricing Page applicable to the Customer at renewal date shall apply.\n\n    3. The Parties’ statutory right to extraordinary termination remains unaffected. An important reason is present for the other contracting party in particular if:\n\n        1. one of the Parties seriously breaches its obligations under the Contract and the other Party can no longer reasonably be expected to abide by the Contract;\n\n        2. the Customer is more than one (1) month in arrears with the payment of due fees or other remuneration, even after the expiry of a reasonable period set by Pitch to remedy the situation;\n\n        3. insolvency proceedings are applied for, instituted or dismissed in respect of all or part of the assets of a Party;\n\n        4. one of the Parties has a reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 Insolvency Statute (*Insolvenzordnung*, \"**InsO**\"); or\n\n        5. the financial circumstances of a Party deteriorate to such an extent that proper performance of the Contract can no longer be expected, even if there is no reason for insolvency within the meaning of Sections 17-19 InsO.\n\n    4. Each termination must be made by declaration in text form.  If the Contract is canceled or terminated by any party, any unused credits will expire immediately and can neither be refunded nor used for a future Contract.\n\n19. ### Secrecy\n\n    1. The Parties undertake to maintain temporally unlimited secrecy regarding all confidential information which they will obtain or have already obtained in the context of the contractual relation and not to disclose or otherwise use such information, unless necessary to perform the Contract. Confidential information are all information and documents of the Parties labeled as confidential or to be considered confidential based on the circumstances, particularly information concerning operating routines, business relations, further business or trade secrets, know-how, all work results, the business model of Pitch, as well as features to which Customers may have early access for testing purposes.\n\n    2. Exempt from this obligation shall be confidential information:\n\n        1. that can be demonstrated to have already been known to the other Party upon initiation of the Contract or become known thereafter through third Parties without any breach of a confidentiality agreement, of statutory provisions, or of administrative orders;\n\n        2. that was known to the general public, unless this was due to a breach of this Contract;\n\n        3. that had to be disclosed based on statutory obligations on the order of a court or authority. As permissible and feasible, the Party obliged to disclosure shall inform the other Party in such event in advance, providing it with the opportunity to take action against the disclosure.\n\n    3. Any disclosure of confidential information to third Parties shall require the express written approval of the other Party, unless otherwise expressly agreed.\n\n    4. The Parties shall ensure through suitable contractual arrangements that the employees and contractors working for them shall also, without temporal restriction, refrain from individual use or disclosure of confidential information. The Parties shall only disclose to employees or contractors confidential information to the extent such employees or contractors need to know the information for the fulfillment of the Contract.\n\n    5. The Customer consents for Pitch to disclose the collaboration between Pitch and the Customer in marketing materials for marketing purposes and in this connection also use the company logo of the Customer. The Customer may revoke this consent pursuant to this Section 18.5 at any time by declaration in text form (e.g. via e-mail to [privacy@pitch.io](mailto:privacy@pitch.io)).\n\n20. ### Data Protection\n\n    1. Pitch treats the Customer's personal data in accordance with data protection standards and specifications.\n\n    2. Pitch acts as a data processor within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR vis-à-vis such customers that feed personal data (*personenbezogene Daten*) of their customers into the Software. As part of the online registration process, the Parties conclude a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR. A completion of the online registration process is not possible without the conclusion of the data processing agreement.\n\n21. ### Final Provisions\n\n    1. The following only applies to customers which legally qualify as businesses (*Unternehmer*) pursuant to Section 14 German Civil Code: Should individual provisions of the Contract of use or other contractual documents be or become invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or should they not contain a necessary provision, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid or unenforceable provision or to fill the loophole, the legally admissible provision shall be deemed to have been agreed retroactively which corresponds as closely as possible to what the Parties would have wished or would have been agreed in spirit and purpose by the Parties if they had considered the invalidity or unenforceability of the provision in question or the loophole.\n\n    2. If these ToU refer to a written form or notification, the sending of an e-mail shall also suffice respectively.\n\n    3. The Contract and the other contract documents are subject to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the German conflict of laws principles and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Statutory provisions on the restriction of choice of law and the applicability of mandatory law in particular of the place where a customer which legally qualifies as consumer (*Verbraucher*) pursuant to Section 13 German Civil Code has its habitual residence (*gewöhnlicher Aufenthalt*) remain unaffected.\n\n    4. Vis-à-vis customers that qualify as merchant (*Kaufmann*), legal entity under public law (*juristische Person des öffentlichen Rechts*) or separate fund under public law (*öffentlich-rechtliches Sondervermögen*), for all disputes arising from or in connection with the Contract or the ToU, including their validity, the District Court of Berlin (*Landgericht Berlin*) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to the extent permitted by law.\n\n    5. The European Commission provides a platform for an online settlement of disputes which can be accessed under [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). Pitch is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions before a consumer dispute settlement commission nor will it do so voluntarily.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},{"type":"marketing-page","isIndexed":true,"title":"Pitch Academy","metaDescription":"Learn how to take your presentations to the next level, win over your audience, and get the most out of Pitch.","metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1666269254/use-case/New-user-webinar/Social_share_-_Webinar.png","customSlug":"/academy","hero":{"variant":"blue","hasPartnersLogos":false,"title":"Pitch Academy","description":"Level up your presentation skills and get the most out of Pitch with expert-led video lessons.","cta":{"label":"","href":"","caption":""},"visual":{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1666268494/use-case/New-user-webinar/Webinar-hero.png","video":null,"ratio":null}},"excerpt":"{{component:textplusvisual [title:Getting started with Pitch] [body:","slug":"/academy","content":"{{component:textplusvisual [title:Getting started with Pitch] [body:\n\nNew to Pitch?

We’ll make sure to provide plenty of notice if anything changes."},{"question":"How will this affect the total price of my plan?","answer":"The total price will vary by workspace based on your chosen plan and the mix of paid seats (owner, admin, or creator) and free commenter roles. Consider assigning infrequent users to the commenter role for better value."},{"question":"What happens to my existing analytics data if I change plans?","answer":"In our new plans, analytics links have usage limits. If your usage exceeds the limit on a new plan, past links will still show analytics and engagement data — but will be disabled, preventing new viewers from accessing them."},{"question":"What happens if I switch to a new plan mid-contract?","answer":"Any unused time on your current plan will be applied as a discount to your new plan. If you have questions about credits or charges, reach out to [support@pitch.com](mailto:support@pitch.com) for help."},{"question":"Why is there a minimum seat requirement for paid plans now?","answer":"Over the past three years, we've seen that users get more value from Pitch — and achieve their goals more effectively — when working together with teammates and other collaborators. The new Pro plan is available to workspaces between 2-25 members, Business allows for 5-200 members, and Enterprise is for any team with more than 30 members."},{"question":"Which plan is right for me?","answer":"The best way to decide on your new plan is to head to the [in-app pricing page](https://app.pitch.com/app/pricing) and explore the full set of features, or to view our updated [public pricing page](https://pitch.com/pricing). Here’s a quick overview:\n\nThe new **Pro** plan is perfect for small teams who want to make their decks stand out with customized videos, interactive embeds, and unbranded exports. It includes 25 analytics links to track who’s viewed your slides as well as features for effective collaboration — like content variables, shared private folders, and the free commenter role.\n\nThe **Business** plan builds on Pro with added perks: Analyze even more presentations with unlimited links, organize media with collections, and unlock SSO when you add 30 or more team members.\n\n**Enterprise** is designed for larger teams that need a custom package with SSO and dedicated support from the Pitch team.\n\nNot sure which plan fits you best?

We have custom slide styles so you can set your colors and upload fonts to ensure consistency, and an asset library so you can ensure that all your decks are always on-brand."},{"question":"What should I look for in a presentation maker?","answer":"A good online presentation maker should have a collection of professionally designed templates for every purpose, each structured in a way that tells a compelling story. It should also be easy to customize the decks, so you can create presentations that meet your needs. In terms of its features, choose a presentation maker that’s effortless to navigate and use. Look for drag-and-drop features, integrations with analytics tools, and functions that make team collaboration and embedding content simple."},{"question":"What features does good presentation software have?","answer":"Pitch’s presentation maker is packed with features that help teams create impressive slide decks faster than ever.\n\n**AI presentation generator:** Jump-start your deck with AI. Just write a prompt and watch your slides magically appear. After picking initial fonts and colors, you can start editing the deck to perfect it with your team.\n\n**100+ free, expert-made templates:** Pitch offers 100+ professionally designed, free-to-use templates. Besides beautiful design, they provide structure to elevate your storytelling and help you deliver your message in a clear and engaging way. Each template is fully editable and easily customizable to fit your brand style.\n\n**Slide layouts:** Choose from almost 100 slide designs — timelines, image grids, diagrams, quotes, and more — that work with any template.\n\n**Millions of free images and animations:** Decorate slides with millions of media options without ever leaving Pitch’s presentation maker. Browse thousands of icons and symbols, Unsplash for stock photos and images, Giphy for GIFs and animated stickers, and Brandfetch for logos.\n\n**Video recordings:** With recordings, you can add video clips to your slides and create engaging presentations that can be watched and rewatched — anywhere, at any time, and on any device. Unlike screen and video recording tools, Pitch lets you edit slide content and redo recordings independently, making future updates a breeze.\n\n**Smart formatting:** Save yourself valuable editing time with smart grouping, swapping, and tidying. Pitch’s formatting features make it easier than ever to create pixel-perfect slides.\n\n**Animations and transitions:** Animate slide content to tell your story point by point. Use transitions to give your whole deck a dynamic feel. With the continuity transition, you can even morph content from one slide to another. Animations in Pitch are thoughtfully crafted to look elegant every time — without the hassle of fiddling with complicated controls.\n\n**Custom fonts:** Pitch supports a variety of freely available font families, but you can also upload your custom fonts to your Pitch workspace to make your presentation on-brand.\n\n**Library:** Manage brand assets like fonts, images, and videos in a shared space to ensure brand consistency across all your team’s presentations.\n\n**Data integrations:** Import data from Google Analytics, Google Sheets, or ChartMogul to any Pitch presentation.\n\n**Real-time collaboration:** Work on slides with your colleagues in real-time without the need to send files back and forth. You can even see each other’s cursors and edits, making collaboration seamless and enjoyable.\n\n**Slide comments, statuses, and assignees:** If you’re working with others on a presentation, you can use slide assignments and statuses to delegate work and track how your deck is progressing. Comments give you a space to ask questions, leave feedback, or engage in discussions.\n\n**Notifications:** Pitch’s notifications make it easy to stay on top of what’s happening across your workspaces. Get updates on the latest activity in-app, via email, or in Slack.\n\n**Speaker view:** The speaker helps you present confidently with a customizable set of aids like notes, upcoming slides, a timer, and a clock.\n\n**Presentation analytics:** You can create multiple links with engagement analytics per presentation. Once you’ve shared a link, you’ll see when someone opens your deck and which slides your visitors view for how long.\n\n**PowerPoint import and export:** Save presentations from PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides as PPTX files to migrate your content into Pitch’s presentation maker. You can also export your Pitch presentations to PowerPoint to collaborate with people who haven’t switched to Pitch yet."},{"question":"Why should I use a cloud-based presentation maker?","answer":"Cloud-based presentation makers allow everyone on your team to collaborate on presentations simultaneously from any location — just remember to give everyone on your team access! You won’t have to worry about saving your presentation or overwriting changes because online presentation makers automatically save your stunning decks to the cloud in real-time."}]},"excerpt":"{{component:textplusvisual [title:Choose from 100+ templates] [body:","slug":"/use-cases/presentation-maker","content":"{{component:textplusvisual [title:Choose from 100+ templates] [body:\n\nFind that creative spark with our [gallery of custom-crafted presentation templates](https://pitch.com/templates).

Find answers to all this and more in our [help center](https://help.pitch.com).","list":[{"question":"How do subscriptions work?","answer":"Pitch subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period (either monthly or yearly), and apply to a single workspace. When you add a member, you’ll pay for their seat from the moment they accept an invite to the workspace, unless they fill an empty seat. When you remove a member from your workspace, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews with the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"What happens if I add members to a workspace on a paid plan?","answer":"If you’re on a monthly plan, we’ll invoice you the next month, based on when you added the member. If you’re on a yearly plan, we’ll invoice you in the following month, based on when you added the member. Additional charges on the yearly plan will be invoiced once per month — so if you add multiple users throughout the month we’ll charge you in one invoice."},{"question":"Is there a time limit on the free plan?","answer":"No — you and your team can use the free plan for as long as you want."},{"question":"How many members can I have on the free plan?","answer":"You can have a total of 5 members in a Free workspace. All members will be admins, however, and have access to all workspace settings."},{"question":"What happens if I remove members from a workspace when I’m on a paid plan?","answer":"When you remove members, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews at the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?","answer":"Yes, you can pay either monthly or yearly. If you choose a yearly plan, you’ll get a discounted price for each seat."},{"question":"Can I invite people outside my organization to collaborate on presentations?","answer":"Yes, you can invite guests to comment on or edit individual presentations. Guests can only see presentations shared with them and will not be able to access other workspace content."},{"question":"Do I need to pay for guests?","answer":"No, but the number of guest seats depends on the plan you choose. You can always upgrade for more guests."},{"question":"What’s the difference between Free, Pro, and Business?","answer":"The Free plan is generous so you and a few friends can create stunning presentations at no cost. The Pro plan gives teams more creative options to deliver high-quality unbranded presentations with native videos, interactive embeds, and custom fonts, alongside workspace management, and some presentation analytics. The Business plan is designed for entire teams, especially those who rely on presentations to win work, since it includes unlimited advanced links."},{"question":"What is the commenter role?","answer":"The commenter role lets you add members to your workspace at no additional cost. They can view and comment on all presentations visible to everyone in your workspace. Commenters can’t edit or create presentations, however. They’re a good option when you need feedback from stakeholders, or use presentations to share information in your team."},{"question":"What are presentation analytics and advanced links?","answer":"Advanced links let you track slide views, time spent on slides, and other data when recipients open a link. They also let you require an email or passcode to access your presentation.

Just open the\nPitch editor and drag your font les onto the slide.\nAlternatively, you can create or select a text block and then:\n• Click on the Font family drop-down in the right-hand panel.\n• Select Upload font.\n• Click Choose font(s) and select the right les from your\ncomputer.\nThere are no limits to how many fonts you can upload, but you\ncan only upload one font family at a time.

In\nsome cases, you may want to leave a guest workspace once you've nished collaborating. Due to\na bug, you could leave the shared presentation, but the workspace would linger. Now, once\nyou've left the presentation, the workspace will go too. Learn more about how guest workspaces\nwork.\n\n💬 Multiple comments can be edited at once\n\nBefore, if you tried to reply to an existing comment while composing a new one, the new one\nwould be deleted.

Boom. Easy.\n\nImprovement\n\nBetter block resizing\nYou can nally resize and reposition multiple\nblocks at once.\nWith this update, values in the layout inspector\ncorrespond to individual blocks instead of the\nselected area. Just select multiple blocks,\nexpand the layout menu, and adjust the height\nand width or X-Y positioning.\n\nImprovement\n\nRe ned UI elements\nWe've made several improvements to our\ninterface. We hope you'll nd these details make\nPitch even more beautiful. This week we:\n• Removed labels from editor toolbar: We've replaced\nthem with fancy new tooltips. Just hover over each\nicon to see them.\n• Introduced a custom scrollbar throughout the app:\nWhenever you nd yourself needing to scroll, you'll\nsee a new, svelte scrollbar instead of the default\noption.\n\nImprovement\n\nMore font size input options\nWe want to give you multiple ways to make\nevery slide pixel perfect. That includes quickly\nadjusting font sizes.\nBeyond selecting an option or entering a\nnumber, you can now adjust the font size with\nthe up and down arrows.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🗂Folder sorting will work with emojis.\n\nDid you know you can add emojis as folder icons? (If not, check our FAQs\nto learn how.) If you did, you might have noticed it broke the alphabetical\nsorting of your folders. And now it doesn't.\n\n🙌\n\n↑ Arrows have been replaced with better arrows.\nAvid readers of these release notes might remember a previous bug x\nrelated to arrow points becoming less pointy at larger widths. We've\ndetermined the best long-term x is to introduce a better, pointier arrow\nshape. This will only affect newly created arrows.\n\n🦊 Presentations can be renamed in Firefox.\n\nWe strive to support every modern browser. And no matter which one you\nuse, you should be able to give your presentation a witty name.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔢 Only \"1.\" will turn into a numbered list.\n\nFor a while, typing any number at the beginning of your text would convert\ninto a numbered list. Now, we'll only suggest it if you start with \"1\" — a very\ngood place to start, in our opinion.\n\n👍 Go to Dashboard will only go to the dashboard.\n\nNot our most revolutionary bug x, but every one counts! Previously, when\nediting a template, if you clicked on the menu and selected Go to Dashboard\nyou'd be taken back to your Templates folder. Now, you'll go back to your\nworkspace dashboard, as originally intended.\n\n💻 Presentations created of ine are easier to re-access.\n\nWe've xed a few errors related to creating presentations while of ine.\nFirst, after creating a presentation, you should immediately see it in your\ndashboard. After you go back online, you shouldn't see an error when trying\nto access your new presentation.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🤝 Shared presentations have more details and actions.\n\nIf you're viewing a shared presentation in the dashboard, the presentation\noptions will show who shared the document with you.

All\ntable cells will update with the pasted\ninformation, and new rows or columns\nwill be added as needed.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nEasier table resizing\nAdjusting the height and width of tables\nused to be a little nicky. We've increased\nthe selection area for each anchor point\nso you can quickly drag to resize any\ntables.\n\n800\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\n600\n\n300\n\nFewer clicks to add\nchart data\n250\n\nWhenever you add a chart to a slide, we'll\nhighlight the rst cell in the data table\nbelow so you can quickly update it with\nthe right gures.\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n📏 Text style drop-downs now have a maximum size.\n\nWhen you add a text block or update its style, a drop-down menu will show a preview of the style.\nBefore, we would show the actual font size, which sometimes lead to text wrapping for titles and\nheadlines. This didn't look great, so we've set a maximum size to help you differentiate between\nstyles without breaking the appearance of the drop-down menu.\n\n🗄 Workspace indicator animates when switching between shared and guest workspaces.\n\nOn the left-hand side of your dashboard, you'll see a list of the workspaces you can access. The\none you're currently in will have a blue bar to its left. Switching between shared workspaces has\nalways had a smooth animation, as the blue bar moves from one to another. Now that same\nanimation works with guest workspaces.\n\n🖱 Scroll position is preserved when going back to the dashboard.\n\nWe now remember where you last were when you opened a presentation. So if you scroll to the\nbottom of a folder to open a presentation, we'll take you back to that position once head back to\nyour dashboard.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n💻 Buttons in Pitch are better optimized for screen readers.\n\nWe've added labels and titles to buttons in Pitch, so if you're using a screen reader to navigate\nPitch, buttons will be announced properly.\n\n🔤 Style builder now includes font controls for tables.\n\nWhen creating a presentation style, you can set style-wide colors and fonts to make broader\nchanges, but you can also update individual settings for titles, shapes, and other elements. We\ndidn't offer the ability to set a font family for tables, which led to some inconsistently applied\nstyles. Now, whether you choose broad or speci c changes, those will be re ected in the look of\nyour tables.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n😅 Fine. Users can exit the What's New presentations.\n\nLast week, the author of these release notes put a hex on the app when she wondered aloud why\nanyone would ever want to leave the What's New presentations. Several users subsequently\nreported being stuck on the What's New tab, unable to reload Pitch or get back to their\ndashboard. Whoops! You can now con dently open and close the release notes. And the author\nwill try to be more careful with her awesome powers.\n\n🎨 Workspace styles can be applied to slides.\n\nFor a short period of time, workspace styles — presentation styles that can be shown to all users,\nregardless of their current presentation — couldn't be selected. Now, you can work with them like\nyou would any other style.\n\n🗂 Closing or switching tabs in the desktop app should be error-free.\n\nOccasionally, interacting with tabs would lead to our dreaded Huh hoh! error and a whole bunch\nof red text in the console logs. We've just completed a large chunk of refactoring work that should\nprevent this from happening in the future.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📦 Bounding boxes will\n\nt around text placeholders with very big text.\n\nTo speed up your work ow, we offer text placeholders, which can be created via keyboard\nshortcuts, double-clicking on your slide, or creating a new slide. Text placeholders for very large\ntext styles would wrap onto a second line, and the bounding box wouldn't follow. Now, the\nbounding box will t around text of any size.\n\n🔄 Duplicating a presentation shouldn't lead to sync errors.\n\nDuplicating a presentation while working of ine, or with a slow internet connection, was leading\nto a sync error for some users. We've corrected the underlying issue, so you're free to duplicate\naway.\n\n👻 Deleted slides won't haunt presentations.\n\nIf someone deleted a slide while you were viewing it in the editor, it would disappear from the\nslide navigator, but its ghost would still be visible in the canvas. Spooky. Fortunately, there's no\nneed to burn sage and cleanse your deck. Now, the editor will update automatically, so you only\nsee existing slides.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🎛 Switching workspaces quickly won't lead to errors.\n\nWe all procrastinate in different ways. Some of us refresh Twitter, others browse Reddit, and a\nfew of us fervently switch between workspaces while waiting for inspiration to strike. If you're in\nthat last group, now you won't have any errors interrupting you.\n\n▶ Switching slides while presenting is speedy again.\n\nOccasionally, switching between slides in presenter mode was noticeably slow. The\naforementioned refactoring has also sped up your switching.\n\n🔢 Number shortcuts now show for guest workspaces.\n\nHover over a workspace icon, and you'll see tool tip with the workspace name and a number. You\ncan press that number on your keyboard to switch to that workspace. Before, we didn't provide a\nshortcut for guest workspaces, but now we do.\n\n📁 Shared with me folder icon color matches other folders.\n\nPrivate presentations teammates share with you show up in Shared with me. Before, the icon\ncolor was gray. Now it's a beautiful blue, just like our other folders.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Analyze this","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"","date":"2020-10-06","tags":["Shapes","Embeds \u0026 Integrations","Templates"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/1019e27e-0f2c-49f8-a1db-fb637d752681?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/Cover_-_Whats_new_-_Oct_6.png","features":1,"improvements":6,"bugs":3,"marketingCopy":"Reporting on website performance is faster than ever with our new Google Analytics integration.

Today's changes make it easier to keep track of\npresentations that are shared speci cally with you.\nInstead of going into your personal workspace, shared\npresentations will now end up in one of two places.\n• Any presentations shared with you by someone from\noutside your workspace will now show up in a guest\nworkspace. Guest workspaces will have a small blue badge,\nso they're easy to spot.\n• If someone from your workspace shares a presentation from\ntheir private folder with you, it will now appear in\nyour shared space, which is right below your default private\nfolder.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nBetter presentation\nsyncing\nWe're continuing to track down and\nremove any hiccups with presentation\nsyncing in Pitch. Next up, we plan to make\nsync error noti cations more actionable\nand offer an of ine indicator, so it's clear\nif your presentation is synced and up to\ndate.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nUpdated tooltips\nOur smart formatting tooltips are back in\ntip-top shape.\nNow, Smart Swapping and Smart Tidying\ntooltips match the rest of the app.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nFaster PDF exports\nExporting a presentation as a PDF should be blazing fast.\nIn order to improve the speed and reliability of our exports, we\nhad to introduce some (hopefully temporary) limitations. Right\nnow, image effects like lters, blur effects, and drop-shadows\nwill not export with the rest of your presentation.\nOur engineers are currently investigating how we can make\nPDF exports fast and a perfect representation of your\npresentation. Stay tuned for more on this.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🗂 Tabs containing a deleted presentation will automatically close.\n\nBefore, if you opened a presentation in the desktop app and deleted it from the web app, the\ndesktop tab would stay open, but trigger an error. Now, the tab will close on its own.\n\n🛠 Workspace tooltips will always show the correct titles.\n\nIf you hover over your workspace icons, you should see a helpful tooltip with the full name and\nnumerical shortcut. For a brief period, the tooltip names were mixed up, but now they're back to\nnormal.\n\n💥 Quickly switching tabs won't crash the app.\n\nSometimes, switching tabs in the desktop app would result in a not-so-jolly \"Huh Hoh!\" error\nmessage. Now, toggling between tabs should work perfectly.\n\n🌈 The play button in the editor will always be purple.\n\nNot every bug x is some fantastic technological feat. Sometimes it's just about double-checking\nthe background colors in the codebase.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📓Changes to a presentation name will show up right away.\n\nYou can name — or rename — a presentation from the Pitch dashboard. Recently, there was a bug\nthat caused the former name to brie y ash before showing the new title. Now, it'll show the new\nname immediately.\n\n🤝We'll only ask you to re-consent once.\n\nWe recently changed our terms of use. So when users logged back in to Pitch, we redirected them\nto a screen asking them to accept our updated terms. Consent is really important, but our\napproach may have been a tad overzealous, as a few of you saw this screen multiple times.\nWhoops! Next time we update our terms, you should only see this screen once.\n\nBLOG POST\n\nBulletins:\nA remote-friendly\nalternative to all hands\nWe realized pretty early on that we\nneeded a better way to keep the\norganization updated. One that was\nasynchronous, agile, and suited to the\nway we work today. That's how we\ndiscovered weekly bulletins: a remotefriendly alternative to all hands.\n\nRead the blog post →\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Beauty in the details","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/190924_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_b7oane.jpg","date":"2019-09-24","tags":["Dashboard","Notifications"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/b5f8689a-b43d-472b-a214-d192a47e1285?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/190924_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_b7oane.jpg","imageDescription":"A visualization of a publicly accessible presentation","features":1,"improvements":1,"bugs":2,"marketingCopy":"Beauty isn't everything, of course.

We've\nincreased the contrast between the title\nand background for better legibility.\nWe've also slightly reduced the font size\nyour snazzy (and sometimes extra long)\npresentation titles.\n\nNEW\n\nof the title, so you have more space for\n\nOLD\n\nNEW\n\n800\n\n800\n600\n\n300\n\n600\n\n250\n\n300\n\nCONSISTENT\n\nINCONSISTENT\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nLABEL\n\nPOSITION\n\n250\n\nLABEL\n\nPOSITION\n\nDISTANCES\n\nDISTANCES\n\nConsistent label positioning for charts\nDepending on the font size, chart category labels would occasionally overlap with or be very far away from a chart.\nNow, no matter the size, labels will always be the same distance away.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n📈 Updated layout of chart-editing controls in the right-hand panel.\n\nWe've rearranged the order of chart-editing options in the right-hand panel to make switching\nbetween chart types smoother. Now, Chart type will always be the rst option after the data\neditor.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📂 Opening Shared with me folder won't affect workspace folders.\n\nIn some cases, opening the Shared with me folder would cause all workspace folders to disappear.\nIn other cases, the folders would be replaced with ones from a user's other shared workspace.\nEither way, not good! We've xed the issue so that opening your shared folder does nothing, zilch,\nnada to your workspace folders.\n\n🥧 Disabled backgrounds for pie charts.\n\nA while ago, we removed background colors for pie charts. However, you could still add one by\ncreating a bar or line chart, setting a background, and then turning it into a pie chart. We're\nmaking our stance on background colors in pie charts (read: they don't look good) clear and\neliminating this workaround.\n\n📈 Chart category options won't disappear from right-hand panel.\n\nIf you turned Show categories off for a line chart or bar chart and then turned it into a pie chart,\nall category options would disappear. While we absolutely, 100% want to remove your ability to\nadd backgrounds to pie charts, we still think you should be able to show or hide category labels.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📐 Chart data tables will resize with the app.\n\nWhen you resize Pitch, the editor will adjust accordingly. Before, when the chart data editor was\nopen, the slide and data table would no longer resize with the app. Now it does.\n\n💨Sync errors will disappear once the app has successfully synced.\n\nNow, after your presentation changes have synced, any sync alerts will go away so you can focus\non your work.\nTyping in text blocks should feel faster.\nWe've made some technical changes that will shave off a few valuable milliseconds when editing\ntext.\n\n🗂 Logging out of Pitch in one tab will log you out in all other tabs.\n\nBefore, if you logged out of Pitch in one tab, you could continue working on presentations in\nother tabs, which led to syncing issues. Now, if you log out once, we'll log you out across all other\nbrowser tabs to avoid any issues.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🎛 Chart controls will show the correct font size.\n\nWhile editing a chart, you can click on any of the text to open up text controls. Before, the font\nsize would always display 40, no matter what the reality was. Now, the font size will show the\nactual font size instead. Revolutionary.\n\n🚪 Leaving a workspace will redirect you to your\n\nrst shared workspace.\n\nLast week, if you left a shared workspace, we'd redirect you to the What's New screen. From now\non, we'll take you to the rst shared workspace you're a member of.\n\n🚨 Pitch will show an error message if we can't save your changes.\n\nWe've improved how we handle events like high energy consumption, low disk space, and running\nPitch while the computer is in sleep mode. If Pitch is in a state where it can't save your changes, we\nwon't allow you to make any. Instead, we'll display an error message and prompt you to refresh\nthe app.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🖼Templates saved from the editor will publish correctly.\n\nTemplates created in and saved from the editor didn't publish correctly and, as a result, couldn't\nbe selected via the template picker. Now, whenever you save a template, it should appear in\nyour Templates folder and immediately be available from the template picker.\n\n📁Workspace folders can be managed while Shared with me folder is open.\n\nPreviously, if the Shared with me folder was open, you couldn't create, rename, or delete\nworkspace folders. Now you can manage workspace folders no matter what you're doing in the\ndashboard.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Celebrating 1 million teams in Pitch","metaDescription":"April 2023 — What’s new in Pitch: Thanks for being one of a million teams in Pitch!

Font Weight has been renamed Font Style\nand now includes all available styles for our\ndefault fonts, including italics, which were\npreviously only available via our inline editor.\nNow you have more ways to take regular ideas\nand present them in a bold way that others\nwon't take lightly.\n\nNew Feature\n\nBetter duplication\nImitation is the sincerest form of attery. We're\nmaking it easier to atter your colleagues by\nimproving how presentations are duplicated.\nPreviously, duplicating a presentation would\nwipe the title, instead giving it the enigmatic\nname of Untitled Presentation. From now on,\nwhen you duplicate presentation it will keep the\noriginal title and add Copy of in front.\n\nNew Feature\n\nA speedier dashboard\nSpeedy\n\nDASHBOARD\n\nWe've rolled out some performance updates to\nimprove your entire Pitch experience.\nMajor highlights include:\n• Fixes related to renaming, moving, and duplicating\npresentations and templates\n• Fixes related to switching workspaces\n• A major reduction in the amount of bandwidth used\nwhen Pitch is running.\n• Lots of behind-the-scenes work and code cleanup\nthat sets the stage for further optimizations\n\nImprovement\n\nmacOS app is Catalina-ready\nCatalina is nice this time of year, don't you think?\nThe Pitch macOS app is now notarized and\nshould open on macOS Catalina without\ndisplaying any extra security warnings. You\nmight still see a pop-up indicating that the le\nwas downloaded from the internet — that's\nokay!\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🐛 PDF export should work as expected.\n\nWe've xed a few pesky bugs related to PDF exports. From now on, you\nshould be able to use the Pitch desktop app to successfully export both\nlarge and small presentation les as PDFs.\n\n◻ Width and height for square and circle shapes will now match.\n\nThis is the type of bug that will make a perfectionist's eye twitch. The height of\nsquare and circle shapes was consistently one pixel more than the width. With\nthis x, the width and height will always be the same.\n\n📊 Charts will render correctly in style editor and PDF exports.\n\nCharts weren't completely rendering in the style editor and PDF exports,\ncausing some confusion and frustration. This has been xed, so you'll always\nsee charts in all their data-loving glory.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖼 Aspect ratio for images dragged onto canvas will be locked by default.\nPreviously, images dragged onto your slide canvas would have an unlocked\naspect ratio. That meant that using the selection box to resize the image\ncould crop out essential parts. Now, by default, your images will have a\nlocked aspect ratio, but you can always change this in the Design tab.\n\n📏 Slide canvas should always be correctly sized for the viewport.\n\nWe've taken some steps to improve canvas resizing. Now the canvas area\nwill automatically adjust so that it's perfectly sized for the viewport.\n\n🧠 Smart Swapping no longer breaks when double-clicked.\n\nSmart Swapping had a bit of a duh moment this past week. Double-clicking\non the swap handler would prevent users from grabbing and swapping\nblocks. We've xed this, so swap to your heart's content.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔗 Links no longer jump when their text block is edited.\n\nEditing a text block with hyperlinked text would lead to the link jumping\nover a space. We've made some updates to text wrapping that will\nprevent this jump from happening in the future.\n\n✂ Small images like logos no longer crop incorrectly when resized.\n\nPreviously we enforced a minimum height and width for image blocks.\nThis contributed to small images like logos accidentally cropping when\nsized down. We've removed minimum size requirements, which should\nprevent unwanted cropping from occurring.\n\n⏰ Invalid session modal should appear less frequently.\n\nSeveral Mac users reported receiving an Invalid Session modal, which would\nsubsequently force them to sign out of Pitch. With this x, the app will try to\nrefresh the access token before showing a modal to the user.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n📝 Shared presentations can be edited by others.\n\nUsers reported having trouble editing presentations shared from other\nworkspaces. From now on, edits made to a shared presentation will be\nvisible to all users.\n\n🔠 Font size will always display the correct value.\n\nWe encountered a bug where text blocks of noticeably different sizes\nhad the same font size value in the right-hand panel.

Kick back and relax another round of release notes, hot off the presses. This week, we introduced:\n* Better link sharing for folders and presentations\n* Quick menu commands for presentation styles\n* Slightly more refined block borders","excerpt":"\nWeekly Release\nMarch 10, 2020","slug":"/whats-new/cut-yourself-some-slack","content":"\nWeekly Release\nMarch 10, 2020\n\n1 Announcement, 1 New Feature, 2 Improvements, 8 Bug Fixes\n\nCut yourself some Slack\n\nAnnouncement\n\nJoin the Pitch beta community\nWe're making it easier to connect with other\nPitch users and the Pitch team. Join our Slack\ncommunity to trade tips and tricks, show off\nyour presentations, and get continuous insight\ninto what we're working on.\n\nJoin the Pitch community\n\nNew Feature\n\nShare links to folders\nSometimes you want your team to review a\nspeci c presentation. Other times, you want\nthem to check out all your fantastic work. For\nthose occasions, sharing a link to a folder is the\neasiest way to go.\nNow, if you right-click on a folder, you'll see an\noption to copy a link. Share this link with any\ncurrent workspace members, and it will take\nthem to the correct folder.\n\nImprovement\n\nA single share link\nEagle-eyed Pitch users may have noticed that\nthe presentation link in your browser was\nslightly different than the one produced by the\nShare button. Now, they're one in the same.\nA couple important reminders about link sharing:\n• Links to presentations in your workspace folders are\naccessible to all workspace members.\n\n• Links to presentations in your private folders are\naccessible to you and people you've invited.\n\n• Links to public presentations can be opened by anyone.\nIf you want to collaborate with someone who\nhas a different email domain, they'll need a Pitch\naccount. Please contact [support@pitch.com](mailto:support@pitch.com).\n\nImprovement\n\nApply styles from the quick\nmenu\nNow you can change the styling of your slides\nwithout touching your mouse.\nFrom the editor, type Opt + T or Alt + T to bring\nup a list of the presentation styles associated\nwith your current presentation and switch to the\none you'd like to apply.\nTo explore everything the quick menu offers,\ntype ⌘ + K or Ctrl + K .\n\nImprovement\n\nBetter block borders\nWe're not joking when we say we sweat the\ndetails at Pitch. For weeks, we've hosted an\ninternal debate on the optimal way to display\nthe bounding box around text. Some were Team\nNo Border; others were Team Padding; for a\nwhile Team Right-Corner Border was winning.\nWe're happy to share that we've now settled on\nfull border with reduced opacity so that you can\nalways see your text cursor. Give it a try and let\nus know what you think.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🤫 Slide statuses won't appear in public presentations.\n\nSlide statuses help your team know which slides are ready to present and\nwhich need a bit more work. We've xed a bug that was displaying the slide\nstatuses of public presentations. Now the status of any slide is something only\nyou and your team will know.\n\n💥 The app won't crash when exiting presenter mode.\n\nWho doesn't like a bit of drama when nishing a presentation? We're all for\nourish, but there are probably better ways to go about it than crashing the\napp. (Doves, maybe?) You can now safely exit presenter mode when\npresenting on the web. Sorry about that.\n\n🖼 Switching slides should be noticeably faster.\n\nWe're using a more reliable technique to preload images on the desktop and\nweb apps. As a result, switching between slides with images is smoother while\nviewing content online or of ine.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🎨 Images with lots of colors should appear picture-perfect.\n\nBefore, images with a high number of colors in their pro le — like images with\ngradients or 3D illustrations — would have some color banding issues. You can\nimagine how frustrating this was for a company that produces lots of 3D\nillustrations! We've xed the underlying bug, so your images will look as\nbrilliant as the rest of your work.\n\n👁 The color of the eye icon for view-only presentations is now correct.\n\nView-only presentations have an eye icon (eyecon?) that appears in desktop\napp tabs. It should appear grey when the tab is active, and white when you're\nworking in a different tab. For a while, it was always grey, but now it should\ndisplay as expected.\n\n🏃 Quick menu will close when switching from dashboard to editor.\n\nBefore, if you brought up the quick menu while editing a presentation, and\nthen moved to your dashboard, the quick menu would stay open. Now it will\nclose.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🕴 We've disabled third-party embeds to prevent clickjacking attacks.\n\nYour security is our top priority. We've temporarily disabled embedding Pitch\npresentations in third-party apps as a proactive measure against clickjacking\nattacks. Secure embedding will be available in the future — hang tight.\n\n🖼 Added restrictions to prevent broken images in presentations.\n\nWe've taken a couple of steps to reduce instances of broken images appearing\nin your presentations. From now on, you won't be able to insert third-party\nimage URLs or data URIs into Pitch. If you try to add an image protected\nby CORS, you'll see an error message.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Cyberpunk stickers, templates, and more","metaDescription":"December 14, 2021 — What’s new in Pitch: We’re shipping three new templates to create sales decks, business models, and futuristic pitch decks.

With the introduction of\nprivate folders and guest workspaces, personal workspaces are no longer\nnecessary.\nWhat's changing?\nAfter today, you won't be able to create presentations in your personal\nworkspace. (But don't worry, you can still view, edit, and share any existing\nones!) We encourage you to move any presentations over to a shared\nworkspace. Once you've removed all presentations, your personal\nworkspace will vanish — poof.\nLearn more in our Help Center →\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nFaster image picker\nThis is one of those mission-critical updates: We've successfully\nreduced the number of clicks it takes to search for and select\nthe perfect image or GIF.\nClick on the image icon in your editor toolbar to open our\nupdated image picker, which puts search front and center.\nEnter a search or click Upload image to add an image to your\nslide.\nPro tip:\nWant to adjust the dimensions of an image? Expand Layout in\nthe right-hand panel to lock or unlock the aspect ratio, change\nthe width or height, and more!\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nCycle between chart types\nIf you're the non-committal type, you'll appreciate this update.\nNow you can change the layout of any chart with the click of a\nbutton.\nAfter you add a chart, you'll see a new section in the right-hand\npanel called Chart type. Click on the bar, pie, or line chart icons\nto change the chart on your slide.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nAdded font palette in style builder\nA few weeks ago, we made it easier to centralize and manage\nthe colors used in your presentation styles. Now we're bringing\nthat same power to fonts.\nOpen the style builder, and you'll see a new section called Style\nfonts. This will display all fonts used in your current style.\nHover over a font to see where it's being used.\nFeeling indecisive? Choose a new font and see it update\neverywhere.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nOpen presentations in a new tab\nWeb app users can now open presentations in a new tab. Just\n\n⌘\n\n-\n\nhold down ⌘ or Ctrl and click on the image preview of the\npresentation you want to open.\n\nor\n\nCtrl\n\n-\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nBetter-looking charts\nData is beautiful. And now you have\nmore beautiful ways to present your data\nin Pitch. Click on a chart, and you'll see\nthese new options:\nLine chart\n• Smooth lines\n• Dashed grid lines\nBar chart\n• Dashed grid lines\nPie chart\n• Padding\n• Rounded corners\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nNo more accidental deletions\nSince the start of our beta in August, only one user has\nreported accidentally deleting a presentation, which is\namazing! But one is one too many. (Sorry about that, Mehdi!)\nNow, before you delete a presentation, you'll be asked to\ncon rm that you want to remove it. (Don't worry, in case you\nstill accidentally delete a presentation, we can help restore it.)\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nClearer error sync\nmessages\nWe're making sync errors more\nactionable.\nFrom now on, if Pitch has trouble syncing\nyour activity, you'll see a new error\nmessage that includes a code. Share that\ncode with customer support, and we'll be\nable to get to the bottom of your speci c\nissue faster than ever.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n↺ Deleting presentations won't lead to in nite error loops.\nDeleting a presentation in one client — like the web app — while having it open in another client,\nwould result in an endless loop of alerts. Now, you should only receive one alert that kindly lets\nyou know you can no longer access the deleted presentation.\n\n🛠 Slider tooltips will render correctly in Safari.\n\nIf you were adjusting a presentation style in Safari, you might have noticed that the tooltips for\nsettings like line spacing and letter spacing looked ... interesting. We've xed the underlying bug,\nso you can see and understand the exact values of any settings you've adjusted.\n\n🎨Workspace styles will be available from private folders.\n\nDid you know that you can publish a presentation style to your workspace? This ensures your\nbrand styles are available to use, no matter what presentation you're working on. Previously,\nworkspace styles didn't show up if you were working on a presentation in a private folder. And\nnow they do!\n\nBLOG POST\n\nShining a spotlight on\nour beta users\nWe now have more than 200 teams using\nPitch to pitch their business, stay in sync,\nand more.

As of this week, working with others is easier than ever. Now:\n* We'll notify you when you're working offline\n* You can click on a user's avatar and jump to the slide they're editing\n* You can adjust letter spacing for text in shapes","excerpt":"\n| Weekly Release\nApril 28, 2020","slug":"/whats-new/follow-along","content":"\n| Weekly Release\nApril 28, 2020\n\n2 New Features · 4 Improvements · 2 Bug Fixes · 2 Blog Posts\n\nFollow along\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nGet notified when you're offline\nOur desktop app is made to support of ine work. You can view\nand edit presentations, and your changes will sync once you're\nback online.\nWe've added a status indicator so that you always know when\nyou're working of ine. When you disconnect, you'll see a cloud\nicon appear in the top left of your dashboard and editor. If you\nsee this message unexpectedly, we've included links to view our\nstatus page and contact support to see what's happening.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\nNEW FEATURE\nNEW FEATURE\n\nJump to a slide to work\nwith others\nGet on the same page, literally and\nguratively.\nIf you're working on a slide with others,\nyou can click on their user avatar, located\nin the top right of your editor, and\ninstantly jump to the slide they're\nworking on. Now, collaborating on a slide\nor following along during a remote\npresentation is easier than ever.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nControl letter spacing\nfor text in shapes\nWe're making text in shapes more\ncustomizable.\nDouble-click on a shape to add text, enter\nyour text, and the right-hand panel will\nupdate to show your shape- and textediting options. With today's update,\nyou'll see a new option for letter spacing.\nJust drag the slider to adjust the distance\nbetween letters.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nDuplicated\npresentation styles are\neasier to track\nThe fastest way to create a new\npresentation style is to start with one of\nours.\nMany users will duplicate a presentation\nstyle and start editing it to match their\nbrand. Now it's easier to see which\npresentation style is the original, and\nwhich is the duplicate. Instead of marking\nduplicate presentations with a subtle\nasterisk, we'll now add \"Copy of\" to the\nstart of the style name.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nWorkspace icons will\nlook the same\neverywhere\nWorkspace owners can set an eyecatching icon for a workspace. If you\nhaven't set one, your default workspace\nicon will be the rst letter of your\nworkspace on a bright background.\nNow, that bright background will be\nconsistent throughout the app. So if you\nuse the quick menu (or keyboard\nshortcut G) to switch between\nworkspaces, the icons will look exactly\nlike they do in your workspace switcher.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nAlways see the correct\ncursor in the dashboard\nYour dashboard provides an overview of\nwhat your company is working on.\nPrivate and workspace folders can be\ncustomized to represent projects, teams\n— anything, really. But some folders —\nlike Home and Templates— can't be\nrenamed.\nThis improvement helps eliminate any\nconfusion on what is and isn't editable. If\nyou single-click and hover over one of\nthese permanent folder names, we'll\ncontinue to show a default cursor instead\nof a text caret.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🤝 Fixed a slew of small bugs around sharing.\n\nAt the start of the month, we began retiring personal workspaces and introduced guest\nworkspaces This change resulted in some small bugs around sharing and accepting invitations to\ncollaborate, amongst other small hiccups. Good news: That's xed now. Go forth and share with\ncon dence.\n\n🛠 Swapped out the Smart Swapping tooltip.\n\nHere's a tongue twister to start your week. We quickly swapped out the Quick Swap tooltip for\nSmart Swapping and replaced it with a smarter and simpler option: Swap.\n\nBLOG POST\n\nA peek into our\ntemplate design\nprocess\nThis comes as no surprise: We spend a lot\nof time thinking about presentations and\ntheir design. In this post, our Senior\nVisual Designer shares her process for\ndesigning the templates many of you use\neach day.\n\nRead the blog post →\n\nBLOG POST\n\nHow we make design\naccessible\nBuilding a truly delightful user experience\nis a team effort.

De nitely\nnot because the original clickable areas\nwere just a little too small.\n\nBudgets\n\nSummer Offsite\n\n$6,000\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nSwitching slides is faster.\nEach week, we ship some behind-the-scenes improvements that help Pitch feel extra snappy. This\nweek's update ensures that switching slides is ultra-speedy.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📱 Public presentations can be viewed on mobile browsers.\n\nWhen trying to open a public presentation on your phone, you would be met with our\ndreaded Huh Hoh! error. If a presentation is public, it should be viewable no matter what. And\nnow it is.\n\n🚨 Leaving a presentation won't result in endless alerts.\n\nWe all deal with separation differently. Before, if you lost access to a presentation while it was\nopen, Pitch would react by showing an in nite number of pop-up errors. The app has shown a lot\nof personal growth this week and will now handle breakups with more grace.\n\n🖼 Exiting the template gallery will take you back to where you left off.\n\nBefore, leaving the template gallery would always take you back to your Home folder. Now, you'll\ngo back to the folder that was open before entering the gallery.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🔢 Numbered lists in tables will behave like the ones in text blocks.\n\nSorry, Petter, this wasn't just a fun easter egg. Before, typing a number ending with \"1.\" into a\ntable cell would create a new numbered list starting at 1, wiping out the original number. From\nnow on, we'll only suggest a numbered list if you're clearly starting from 1.\n\n🎨 Colors added to the color picker using the inline editor will include transparency.\n\nBefore, you could use the inline editor to add a semi-transparent color to your presentation, but\nthe preview added under Used colors would ignore transparency settings. We've updated this so\nthat the color picker accurately re ects the colors in your presentation.\n\nBLOG POST\n\n3 months, 50+ updates:\nQ2 in review\nIf you're new to Pitch or a — gasp!\n— infrequent release notes reader, you\nmay have missed some important\nupdates.\nIn this post we highlight a few of the most\nexciting things we've shipped since April\nand discuss what's next for Pitch.\n\nRead the blog post →\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Invite members on mobile \u0026 new templates","metaDescription":"August 31, 2021 — What’s new in Pitch: Invite and manage team members on our mobile apps.

We've also\nupdated the default width of borders to be\nslightly thinner.\n\nImprovement\n\nFewer sync failures\nFrom now on, we won't show a Failed to\nsync alert unless there's an actual issue syncing\nthe content in your presentation.\nThat means that when you're working of ine,\nyou won't see an alert. Once you're back online,\nyour presentations should sync and show the\nmost recent updates.\n\nImprovement\n\nFaster editor (again!)\nFaster\n\nEDITOR\n\nWe want to help you and your team move faster\nin Pitch. That's why we're always working on\nperformance improvements behind the scenes.\nThis week we enabled progressive rendering for\nslide previews. Opening the presentation editor\nshould be faster than ever.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖼 Images added while working of ine won't disappear after restarting.\n\nOne of the best reasons to use our desktop app (besides tabs!) is that it offers\nthe ability to work of ine. Before, images you added while of ine weren't\nstaying put. If you restarted the app, the images would be lost until you went\nback online. From now on, images added while of ine will show up and stay in\nplace, of ine and online.\n\n🔗 Public presentations will show the correct preview.\n\nIf you share a link to a public presentation, you should see the link unfurl to\ndisplay the title and a preview of the cover slide. We xed a bug that caused\nthe preview image to appear cut off. If you don't see this change immediately,\nmake a quick update to your cover slide to make sure the preview\nregenerates.\nTable selection frames will match the table dimensions.\nResizing table height would sometimes lead to the selection frame being a\ndifferent size from its table. Now, they'll always have the same dimensions.\n\n📏\n\nBug Fixes\n\n👯 Only one swap icon will show at a time.\n\nYou should only see the swap icon when you select a block that's actually\neligible for Smart Swapping. Due to a bug, the swap icon would appear even\nwhen that wasn't the case. We xed that and a few other small swapping bugs.\n\n📖 Synced presentations can be successfully re-opened while of ine.\n\nAfter going of ine and restarting the desktop app, some presentations were\nno longer accessible. They were either uneditable or would trigger\na Presentation not found error. Now, synced presentations should open as\nexpected while of ine.\n\n🔤 Pressing Shift while selecting text range works again.\n\nWhen working in a text block, you should be able to press Shift on your\nkeyboard and use your mouse to select part of the text. This temporarily\nstopped working, but is now xed.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🛠 Tooltips for active presentation reviewers will always appear.\n\nWhen working on a presentation with others, you should see their user\navatars in the top right of your editor. Hovering over each avatar will reveal a\ntooltip with their name. Recently, it would appear brie y and disappear right\naway, or not show for every user. While we love a bit of mystery and intrigue,\nwe know it's essential to know who you're collaborating with. Now, tooltips\nwill remain visible while hovering over an avatar.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Joining workspaces on mobile \u0026 guest player","metaDescription":"March 29, 2022 — What’s new in Pitch: Create and join workspaces on mobile at any time.

Our desktop app\nnow supports tabs so that you can work across\nmultiple presentations at once.\nIf you open a presentation and then head back\nto your workspace dashboard, you'll notice that\npresentation will still be available in a new tab.\nWith tabs, you can have multiple presentations\nopen at once. If you want to close a tab, just click\nthe X next to the presentation title.\nStill not using our desktop app? Download Pitch\nfor macOS or Windows.\n\nNew Feature\n\nNew quick menu options\nA few enhancements to our quick menu to\npower up your work ow. Now you can:\n\n🙌\n\n• Open presentation [O]: Search ( ) and open a\npresentation directly from the quick menu! This\nworks from dashboard and the editor.\n• Assign a slide [A]: Bring up a list of people and identify\nwho is responsible for each slide. You can assign slides\nto workspace members and external collaborators.\n• Set a slide status [Option+S or Alt+S]: Note if a\nslide needs work, is in progress, or is ready to present.\n• Jump to a slide [J]: Quickly move to a speci c slide in\nyour presentation.\n\nUse ⌘+K or Ctrl+K to bring up the quick menu\nand explore all Pitch shortcuts.\n\nNew Feature\n\nEmbed Loom videos\nLoom enhances the way people communicate at\nwork through instantly shareable video.\nNaturally, we're big fans.\nEmbed Loom videos in your Pitch presentations\nto help onboard a customer, demo a new\nfeature, or expand on internal updates to your\nteam.\nWe have more embeds on the way. Reach out\nand let us know what you'd like to see!\n\nNew Feature\n\nAlign and distribute blocks\nYou asked, we answered: Now you can align and\ndistribute blocks to quickly clean up your slides.\nJust select multiple blocks — you can even mix\nblock types — right-click to bring up the context\nmenu, and choose Align or Distribute.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔶 Resetting a shape style to its default won't delete text.\n\nReset to default is a handy way to override any inline edits, as it will take a\nmodi ed block, like text or a shape, and revert it to its original style. This\nbutton didn't play well with our text in shapes update and would remove all\ntext. Now text added to shapes won't go anywhere until you say so.\n\n🏡 Presentations can be dragged back into the Home folder.\n\nThis might give some of you déjà vu. For a short while (again), there was a bug\nthat prevented your presentations from going home — speci cally to the\nHome folder in your dashboard. This has been xed, also again. And hopefully\nfor good.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Lending a hand","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200512_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_xq86vz.jpg","date":"2020-05-12","tags":["Dashboard","Images \u0026 Icons","Notifications","Templates"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/f8ab09fe-c187-4a21-96fd-4d4b11108dac?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200512_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_xq86vz.jpg","imageDescription":"A Pitch sticker stating BUILT WITH PITCH and four chubby hands","features":2,"improvements":2,"bugs":"13","marketingCopy":"We all need an extra set of hands now and then.

It will feature a preview of\nthe assigned slide and tell you who\nassigned it so you can follow up with\nthem.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nMore stickers to choose from\nGIFs are great, images can be impressive, but nothing makes a\nslide stand out quite like a sticker.\nWe've added two new batches of stickers for all your\npresenting needs:\n• Chubby hands: All hands on deck? All hands on your deck!\nWhether you want to point something out or add some\nlevity, this sticker pack's got you covered.\n• Pitch badges: Let the world know that you're experiencing\nthe future of presentations — today! — with our badges. (If\nyou use these in a public presentation, let us know in our\nSlack community so we can help share your work.)\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nImproved shared folder name\nPrivate folders in Pitch have been a hit. But the Shared folder,\nwhich we recently added to that section, was a bit of a headscratcher.\nWe've updated the name to Shared with me to re ect how this\nfolder actually works. Now presentations will appear in Shared\nwith me if a workspace member shares a presentation with you\nfrom their private folder.\n\nLearn more in our Help Center →\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nRefined existing\ntemplates\nYour favorite Pitch templates are now\neasier to customize.\nThis week, we updated our templates to\ntake advantage of the latest\nimprovements to presentation styles.\nNow, if you make changes to one of the\ndefault presentation styles, or apply your\nbranded style, the results should look\nmuch nicer.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nConsistent workspace colors\nIf your workspace owner hasn't added a custom image, your\nworkspace icon will be the rst letter of your workspace on a\nbright-colored background.\nThis color used to be generated based on the position of a\nworkspace in a user's switcher, meaning workspace members\nmight see different colors. Now, it'll be the same for all\nmembers of a workspace.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🎨 Presentation style previews are now more accurate.\n\nYour presentation style previews — available under the Design tab in the right-hand panel — offer\nan at-a-glance view of the colors and fonts used in a style. We've made some improvements to\ngive you a better sense of the font and unique colors used in any given style.\n\n🖼 Cover slide previews in unfurled links won't appear cropped.\n\nIf you share a link to a public presentation in Slack, we'll unfurl it to reveal the title and cover slide.\nFor a brief period, the cover slide looked cropped, but now it should be pixel-perfect.\n\n👯 Duplicating presentations from shared spaces now works.\n\nBefore, duplicating a presentation from a guest workspace or in your shared folder didn't work.\nNow, when you duplicate a presentation, we'll place it in the default private folder of your target\nworkspace.\n\n🛠 Tweaked tooltip alignment throughout the app.\n\nTooltips that also display keyboard shortcuts are now correctly centered. Easy enough!\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n💻 Disabled\n\nipping options for tables. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n\nDon't ip out, but we've removed the ability to ip tables from the right-hand panel.\n\n🥕 Caret will appear in empty table cells. (Safari)\n\nIf you were editing a table while working in our web app, you might have noticed that the caret —\ni.e., the ashing vertical line — wasn't visible. Without the caret, it's impossible to understand if a\ncell is selected and able to be edited. We've xed the issue, so you always know what you're\nediting.\n\n👀Always see who's shared a presentation with you.\n\nWhen someone gives you view-only access to a presentation, the share button will have limited\noptions. You can see who else has been invited to collaborate and copy a link to the presentation.\nWe should also show you who originally shared a presentation with you, but due to a bug, the\nuser's name didn't appear. We've corrected this so you can see who rst shared the presentation\nwith you.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🔔 Sharing noti cations will appear while in focus mode.\n\nFocus mode is an alternative to presenter mode and lets you hide the editor and, well, focus on\nyour content in Pitch. However, you can still invite others to the presentation you're viewing or\ncopy a link to the presentation. Now, when use one of our sharing options, we'll show you a\nnoti cation just like we do when you're in the editor.\n\n🗂Release notes will open in a new tab.\n\nNo matter what workspace you're in, you should be able to see what's new in Pitch. Now, when\nyou click on What's new? in your dashboard, our weekly release notes will open in a new tab for\neasy browsing.\n\n🚨 Opening a presentation you don't have access to will show an error.\n\nBefore, if you tried to open a link to a presentation that wasn't shared with you, the results would\nbe a little unclear. You wouldn't see the presentation, but we wouldn't tell you what went wrong.\nNow, we'll show an alert so you can try to resolve the issue.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🥧 Disabled background colors for pie charts.\n\nWe've removed the ability to add a background color to your pie charts. Why? Well honestly,\nbecause it doesn't look good. If you really want to add a background color to your pie chart,\nplease reach out and let us know.\n\n👽 Improved a few issues with table spacing and resizing.\n\nFirefox users, we've xed an error that was swallowing up precious spaces in tables. Now your\nwords will have some space to breathe. Additionally, tables should no longer lock their height —\nas long as there's space available, you can resize them.\n\n🏃 Exit presentation button in public presentations works as expected.\n\nBefore, if you entered presenter mode in a public presentation, the only way to exit was to press\nesc. Now, you can also click Exit presentation, which previously existed but didn't do anything.\n\nBLOG POST\n\nCommunicating \u0026\ncollaborating through\nchange\nOur rst remote employee (and budding\nsocial media star) Oskar Zabik offers\npractical tips on how team leads and\nmanagers can adapt to remote work.

Before expanding a thread to\nview replies, you'll now see the avatar of any collaborator who\nleft a comment.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nReal-time co-editing is\nclearer\nNow, when a collaborator edits a text\nblock, Pitch will indicate that they're\ntyping. Additionally, any changes they\nmake will now be visible, even while the\ntext block is selected. Don't worry, we\ndon't show every keystroke, so there's\nstill time to correct those pesky tpyos.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n📊 Chart labels now use consistent padding and margins.\n\nBefore, category and value axes were slightly different between chart types. So even if two charts\nhad the exact same width and height, labels would appear a bit off. Now everything should line up\nperfectly.\n\n🔍 Searching \"new,\" \"create,\" or \"add\" in the quick menu will pull up similar results.\n\nNow, searching for any of the above terms will surface creation-related actions in the quick menu,\nsuch as creating a presentation, template, or folder, or adding a comment.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🔤 Custom font weights and styles should work properly in the style builder.\n\nWe xed a few bugs in the style builder that affected custom fonts. Now, any supported font\nweight should be available to work with in the style builder.\n\n🔥 Charts won't overheat your CPU.\n\nWe thought we'd xed this for good a few weeks ago, but here goes again. Software, eh? When\nviewing charts in the desktop app, Pitch shouldn't cause any CPU spikes.\n\n✂ Cut keyboard shortcut works properly in Safari.\n\nBefore, typing in Command + X (would cut content, but wouldn't copy it to your clipboard. Now,\ncut, copy, and paste should work as expected.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Make things disappear with exit animations","metaDescription":"August 2023 — What’s new in Pitch: Animate blocks and groups off a slide.

Move their position in your current\npresentation, or copy them over to a new one.\nYou can also take bulk actions on slides! Right-click on your\nselection (or use the quick menu) to apply a presentation style,\nset a status, or assign multiple slides at once.\nWe're con dent that this will help you work faster and more\neffectively with your team. Let us know what you think about\nthis update in our Slack Community.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nSee what's next with\nspeaker view\nBe extra prepared for your next\npresentation.\nWith speaker view, you can control the\npresentation and see a preview of your\nnext slide. This is perfect for presenting\non multiple screens: Use one to present\nyour content, and the other to see what's\nup next.\nEnter presenter mode, and you'll see an\noption to open speaker view in a separate\nwindow.\n\nNEW FEATURE\nPERSONAL WORKSPACE\n\nSHARED WORKSPACE\n\nPreserve comments\nfrom your personal\npresentations\nWe're retiring personal workspaces at\nthe end of May. If you want to keep your\npersonal presentations, you'll need to\nmove them over to a shared workspace.\nToday's update means that you can safely\nmove over presentations without losing\ncomments. However, you will need to\nreinvite any collaborators you want to\ncontinue working with.\nLearn more in our Help Center →\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nBEFORE:\n\nQ1\n\nBetter label positioning for pie\ncharts\n\n300\n\nPie and donut charts get a bad rap in the data visualization\n\n800\n\nworld. But here at Pitch, we love them.\n\nQ2\n\nThis week we showed our appreciation for this circular wonder\nby improving the positioning of data labels. Our new\npositioning algorithm will make sure your labels look great and\n\nAFTER:\n\ndon't overlap.\n\nQ1\n300\n\nIn addition to improving the current positioning, we've\nintroduced a new option: callout positioning. If you want to try\nit out, click on one of the data points in your chart to open the\nediting options, go to Position, and select Callout.\n\nQ2\n800\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nUpdated title bar across Pitch\nWe've started giving the app a makeover. Beyond making things sleeker, we've added the presentation title to your\neditor toolbar. Note that getting back to your dashboard is a little different now. For the desktop app, you'll need to\nclick on the dashboard icon; in the web app, you'll see a back arrow.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nShare links to templates\nWe've added the Share button back to\ntemplates, so you can easily share links\nwith other workspace members.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n💥 Opening the style builder in a guest workspace won't crash the app.\n\nIf someone outside your workspace invites you to edit a presentation, you'll be able to leave\ncomments, adjust text, and even change the overall styling. We've xed a bug that prevented\nusers from doing that last activity.\n\n🤝 Sharing a link to a speci c slide works again.\n\nLinking to an individual slide is extremely handy. You can instantly point out the relevant material,\ninstead of having to type a message or specify a page number. For a brief period, this wasn't\nworking, but we're happy to share that we've xed the issue. Just click the Share button,\ncheck Link to current slide, click Copy link, and share away!\n\n🔗 Accepted invite links will always work.\n\nWorkspace invite links expire after seven days. Previously, this applied to both accepted and\nunaccepted invites. Now, if you accept a workspace invite, you can still reuse the original link to go\nback to the workspace at any time.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🏡 Always navigate to the right workspace dashboard when exiting a presentation.\n\nIf someone outside your workspace shares a presentation with you, you'll have easy access to it\nvia a guest workspace. Before, if you accepted an invite, opened the presentation, and then left to\ngo back to your dashboard, you'd be taken to your personal workspace. Now, you'll see the guest\nworkspace, as expected.\n\n🙅 Cancel out of creating a new workspace.\n\nIf you've ever clicked on the plus sign at the bottom of your workspace switcher, we may have\nforced you into creating a workspace. Whoops! The Cancel button now works, so if you don't\nwant to create or join a workspace, you can exit and go back to yours.\n\n📂 Presentations created in a folder will stay there.\n\nLast week, we found out some presentations appeared in your personal workspace or the Home\nfolder of your shared workspace when they weren't supposed to. We've resolved the issue, so\npresentations created in a folder will stay there unless you move them.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n💾 Shared presentations cannot be saved as templates.\n\nPresentations shared speci cally with you will show up in the Shared folder of your workspace or\nin a guest workspace. Before, we showed the option to save shared presentations as a template.\nHowever, this created some issues: Where are these presentations supposed to live? Would the\npresentation creator want that content to be available to their entire workspace? Real\nconundrums. Until we can work through these larger questions, we've disabled the ability to save\nshared presentations as templates.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Need a chart?

Before, when making a presentation\npublic, you'd have to copy a link from the Share\ndialog so others could see your work.\nNow, if you're using the web app, you can also\ngrab the URL in your browser. When you share\nthis link with people outside of your workspace,\nthey'll be redirected to the public access view.\n\nImprovement\n\nRenamed Library tab\nWe've taken the Library tab in the right-hand\npanel and updated the name to Templates. Now\nnding, browsing, and using pre-installed or\nnewly created presentation templates should be\nclear and easy.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🧹We won't ask you to re-tidy your already tidied blocks.\n\nWe've done some tidying of our own. From now on, the Smart Tidy wand\nwill only appear if the selected blocks can be tidied. Previously it would\nappear even when content was already perfectly aligned.\n\n🔠 Resetting default text styles will override any inline styling.\n\nChanging the text style (e.g., converting a headline to a subheadline) or\nclicking Reset to Default will reset the text block to match the active\npresentation style and will remove any inline styling.\n\n↖ Fixed text selection in Chrome, Firefox, and the desktop app.\n\nUsing the cursor to select a section of text within a text box wasn't working as\nexpected. When dragging the cursor outside the box, it would stop selecting\nnew text. With this x, you can continue dragging to select text when your\ncursor goes outside the box.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖼 Unnecessary background image options have been removed.\n\nWe've simpli ed the right-hand panel options for background images, so\nfewer users will be tempted to add rounded corners and drop shadows to\nimages that stretch across the entire canvas.\n↑ Big arrows will keep distinctive points.\nIncreasing the width of arrows caused the arrowhead to blur into the rest of\nthe shape. Now you can con dently use big arrows to point out items on\nyour slide.\n\n📧 Cursor in email input\n\neld won't jump.\n\nTypos happen to the best of us. If you need to correct an email address while\nsharing a presentation, you can move the cursor to the right part of the email\ninput eld without the cursor jumping to the end.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n✂ Logos will not be cropped when resized.\n\nUsers pointed out that scaling down logos — even when the aspect ratio was\nlocked — would result in the image being partially cropped on some screen\nsizes. With this x, any new image dragged onto the canvas will not be\ninadvertently cropped when resized.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Publish presentations \u0026 mobile speaker notes","metaDescription":"July 5, 2022 — What’s new in Pitch:  We're giving you a place to build an audience around your work.

Just click on the\nshare button, turn on public access, and copy an embed code.\nRight now, embeds will work with any site that supports HTML\nand iframe. We're still working to add oEmbed and Embedly\nsupport, which will enable you to share presentations on\nMedium and sites powered by WordPress.\nIs there a speci c spot where you'd like to embed your\npresentations? Join our Slack community and share your\nthoughts.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nRename presentations from the\neditor\nUntitled presentation. So intriguing, so full of possibility.\nGive your presentation a more tting title without heading\nback to your dashboard. Click the drop-down arrow next to\nyour title or click on the title and rename your presentation\nor\n\nright away.\n\nNEW FEATURE\n\nAutomatically join new workspaces\nWe're making it easier to join your team's workspaces.\nIf you've set an approved domain from your workspace, you\ncan share a link to your workspace and Pitch users with the\nsame email domain will automatically join.\nIf a colleague is new to Pitch, they'll see the option to join your\nworkspace while creating an account.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nUpload custom fonts\nfrom the style builder\nNow you can upload new fonts while\nediting your presentation style.\nAdd as many licensed fonts or Google\nfonts as you'd like. Just remember that\nonce a font has been added to your\nworkspace, it can't be removed. Check\nout our guide to uploading fonts in case\nyou could use a refresher.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n🗑After deleting a block, a new one will not be automatically selected.\n\nBefore, if you deleted a block from a slide, Pitch would automatically select a nearby one. We've\nremoved this, so you can choose exactly what you'd like to select next.\n\n🎨 Color picker will point out which colors are semi-transparent.\n\nIt was a little tough to look at the color picker and differentiate which colors were solid and which\nweren't. Now, semi-transparent colors will feature a checkered pattern in the image picker so that\nthey're easier to spot.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n📊 Your computer won't get loud when viewing Pitch charts.\n\nData is thrilling — we know! A few desktop app users reported that their computers were getting\na little overexcited when viewing presentations with charts. We've xed the underlying issue, so\nyou should no longer see any CPU spikes.\n\n🚪 Pitch won't crash when you lose access to a presentation in a guest workspace.\n\nIf you're removed as a guest collaborator, Pitch won't throw a hissy t and show an endless loop\nof error messages.\n\n🔵 Shapes won't change opacity when editing text.\n\nDouble-clicking on a shape to edit text would temporarily revert it to 100% opacity.\n\n💌 Guest workspace email digests now have an accurate subject line.\n\nDaily email digests from guest workspaces were still using the personal workspace subject line.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n💬 Keyboard navigation between slides works when comment input is open.\n\nBefore, you couldn't move between slides with your arrow keys while a comment was waiting to\nbe typed. Now, you can easily move forward and backward while determining which slide is\nworthy of your pithy observations.\n\n🔤 Text placeholders won't become actual text when auto-width is switched on.\n\nAdjusting the width of text blocks would sometimes result in placeholder text being converted\ninto actual text.\n\n📋 Presentation titles can be copied without issue.\n\nBefore, you could double-click on a title to select and copy the text, but you couldn't drag to\nselect. Instead, the entire card would be selected and dragged.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Share interactive presentations in Notion","metaDescription":"May 11, 2022 — What’s new in Pitch: Share Pitch decks with your team thanks to our new Notion integration.

Now the border will remain visible so\nthat you always know if content is going off canvas.\n\n⤴ Rotate multiple blocks at once.\n\nWith this x, you can select multiple blocks and use the rotation options in the\nright-hand panel to rotate them at the same time.\n\n⤵ Pressing\n\nEnter in the rotation input won't add text to your block .\n\nYou can use a handler to adjust the rotation of blocks, or you can manually\ninput the desired degree of rotation. For a while, typing in a number and\npressing Enter would then type \"Enter\" on the selected block. We've xed\nthis, so you can safely rotate to your heart's content.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔒 Denying Google access permissions will not crash the app.\n\nThis x affects new users. Last week we rolled out a change to our Google\nsignup ow that would ask users to grant permissions. Denying access would\ncrash the app. Now, denying access will redirect you to the login screen.\n\n🎨 Border colors of shapes will show up as suggestions in the color picker.\n\nThis x is pretty straightforward. Your color picker includes suggestions based\non recently used colors. Those suggestions now include border colors of\ncurrent shapes. Enjoy!\n\n📐 Adjust the aspect ratio of multiple blocks at once.\n\nYou can now select multiple blocks and adjust the aspect ratio in the righthand panel — just expand the Layout section to view and change these\noptions.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Spring cleaning","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200616_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_txidjx.jpg","date":"2020-06-16","tags":["Dashboard","Editor"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/58b46f04-a521-4711-be71-08f039f5756b?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200616_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_txidjx.jpg","imageDescription":"An illustration of an individual and a magic hat filled with different objects","improvements":6,"bugs":8,"marketingCopy":"Summer is just a few days away, so we're sneaking in some final spring cleaning. This week we've polished and decluttered Pitch to make it faster, shinier, and more reliable. Here's what's new:\n* **Add slide** button is back and better than ever\n* Our sidebar has been beautified\n* Personal workspaces are officially gone","excerpt":"\n| Weekly Release\nJune 16, 2020","slug":"/whats-new/spring-cleaning","content":"\n| Weekly Release\nJune 16, 2020\n\n6 Improvements · 8 Bug Fixes · 1 Blog Post\n\nSpring cleaning\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nAdded Add slide button\nThe Add slide button has made its triumphant return to the\neditor. Pressing this will add a blank slide — as opposed to one\nof your template slides — to your presentation.\nIf you're in a hurry, you can also press N on your keyboard to\nadd a blank slide.\n\nIMPROVEMENT\n\nBeautified sidebar\nWe've added some extra polish to make Pitch pop. This includes\na grey background to separate the workspace switcher and\nsidebar options and one-pixel borders to make the app look a\nbit crisper.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n👋 Personal workspaces are of cially gone.\n\nWith the introduction of private folders and guest workspaces, personal workspaces became\nunnecessary. They have now been retired along with any presentations they contained. If you\ncreated an account before April 15 and didn't transfer your presentations before the move, reach\nout to [support@pitch.com](mailto:support@pitch.com) and we'll happily help you retrieve them.\n\n✨ Modals and popovers are more consistent.\n\nThis week, we took some time to improve the consistency of the footers and buttons used across\nmodals and popovers in Pitch.\n\n🏃 Pitch is a little bit faster.\n\nIn particular, opening a large presentation and switching from focus mode to the editor are\nzippier.\n\n📹 Video embeds can be shown in full-screen from the editor.\n\nFull-screen playback for videos worked in presenter mode and focus mode, but was turned off in\nthe editor. Now you can enter full-screen in any view.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n💨 Text edits won't get lost.\n\nRarely, errors would result in text blocks reverting to their previous text. We now handle these\neditors more gracefully, so you won't lose any text.\n\n🔤 Custom fonts will display in speaker view.\n\nBefore, when entering presenter mode, your audience would see custom fonts just ne, but the\nspeaker view would show a default font. Now, both will display any custom fonts used in a\npresentation.\n\n🔴 Editor will always show the correct color of text in shapes.\n\nDue to a bug, the color of text added to a shape stopped matching the color displayed by the color\npicker. Now they should always be aligned.\n\n🙅 User avatars won't\n\nicker.\n\nYou may have noticed some extra excitement in the editor last week, as user avatars ickered\nacross the toolbar and slides. We've xed the underlying issues and have effectively put a stop to\nthis impromptu dance party.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🎛 All fonts can be bolded via the inline editor.\n\nBefore, fonts without a bold style could be bolded via the right-hand panel, but not via the inline\neditor or keyboard shortcuts. Now, you can always add a faux bold when a true option isn't\navailable.\n\n📔 Public presentations will display their title.\n\nPublic presentation titles mysteriously went missing. They're back again — you'll see titles in the\nbrowser tab and appropriately named title bar.\n\n🎨 Dragging and dropping template slides won't override a modi ed style.\n\nBefore, modi ed presentation styles would be reset when dragging in a template slide that used\nthe original style. Now, you can drag in slides from the original template without it affecting\nmodi ed styles.\n\n📂 Folders won't jump when renamed.\n\nRenaming a folder would cause the label and icon to jump to the left. Now both will stay perfectly\nput.\n\nBLOG POST\n\nWhy you should build\nfeatures users don't ask\nfor\nOften, people aren’t aware of what they\nneed, or even what they want.

Here are the new\noptions:\nUse as background: Select an image block and turn it into a\nbackground image.

If the\nimage was added during your current\nsession, we'll show you the query you\nused to discover that perfect picture or\nglorious GIF.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\n😱 Unsplash staff picks won't make your boss blush.\n\nWe've added a lter to Unsplash's staff picks, so when you open the media picker, none of the\ndefault results should be NSFW.\n\n💬 New comment drafts are saved with each slide.\n\nBefore, unpublished comments would follow you around the deck you were viewing.

Now, the selection area will always t around the text.\n\n🔤 Presentation styles will always have a style font.\n\nThe presentation styles for our starter templates didn't properly display a style font. This was\nonly noticeable when creating a new template in the Templates folder. Now, no matter where\nyou're editing a style, it should always show the font family in use.\n\n📐 Presentation cards will crop properly when dragged.\n\nPresentation cards occasionally looked funky when being dragged in the dashboard. Now, the\ntop-left of the card should always appear right under your cursor.\n\n▶ Presentation embeds can be viewed in fullscreen mode across Firefox and Safari.\n\nWe've improved browser support for our new presentation embeds.

This change ensures that any inline\nchanges — like bolding a few words of text in a paragraph — will properly adjust if you apply a\npresentation style with a different font.\n\n💬 Comments on private presentations will be preserved when moved to a shared folder.\n\nAs a privacy measure, we used to wipe comments on private presentations once they were made\navailable to the rest of your workspace. Now, we'll preserve those comments, so you don't lose\nany important notes or feedback.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🖼 Templates, styles, and fonts in private presentations can be accessed by collaborators.\n\nSharing private presentations with members of your workspace resulted in some funky (and\nunneccesary) limitations. Now you shouldn't have any issue accessing any of the fonts and\ntemplates available in your workspace, and will have the option to publish any presentation style\nso the rest of your team can work with it.\n\n🦾 Password strength will only be assessed when creating a password.\n\nWe were showing a password strength error at the wrong stage of the sign-up ow, namely when\nusers entered their names. Now it will show up at the right stage. There are two takeaways here:\n\n1. Please don't use your name as a password. Ever. 2) Your name is not weak and de nitely\ndoesn't need numbers or special characters. It's perfect the way it is.\nQuick menu won't promote unrelated image commands.\nBefore, if you entered a search term in the quick menu while an image was selected, the top\nresults would always be related to image positioning. Now, it will only return results related to\nyour search.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n🔤 Font size picker will close when you open another drop-down option.\n\nBefore, it was possible to have multiple drop-down options open at once while editing text.

Now items should swap horizontally or vertically\n— not diagonally.\nGrid view for templates will display rows of two\nNormally, when viewing a speci c template in the right-hand panel, you have\nthe option to show it as a list (a single row of thumbnails) or a grid (two\nthumbnails per row). When clicking on the grid icon, a bug would take the user\nback to the overview of available templates. This has been resolved, so you\ncan view templates in whichever layout works best for you.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nThe opacity slider no longer moves right-clicked blocks\nYeah, this was an odd bug. Right-clicking to select a block and then adjusting\nthe opacity slider in the right-hand panel would move the entire block instead\nof changing the opacity.\n\n📰 In the Press\nDid you see the news?\nLast week was an exciting one for the Pitch team\n— we announced an additional $30M in funding\nas well as the expansion of our invite-only beta.\nIn case you missed it, here's a roundup of the\nnews:\n\n🔗 TechCrunch\n🔗 CNBC\n🔗 VentureBeat\n🔗 [Tech.eu](http://tech.eu/)\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"The shape of things to come","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200218_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_sk6e9f.jpg","date":"2020-02-18","tags":["Images \u0026 Icons","Shapes","Workflow"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/515f85f5-f8f7-44df-8671-af2d6eeed32b?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/200218_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_sk6e9f.jpg","imageDescription":"Visualization of multiple shapes in different arrangements","features":1,"improvements":4,"bugs":9,"marketingCopy":"This week we're focusing on precision — removing extra clicks or steps, scrubbing out redundancies, and helping you and your team work more efficiently.

Just double-click on a shape and\nstart typing.\n\nImprovement\n\nRemoved redundant helper text\nBeing clear and concise is essential. And stating\nyour point without using too many confusing\nwords is key.\nThe helper text in the share dialog for private\npresentations told you some things you already\nknew, so we got rid of it.\n\nImprovement\n\nDe ned image upload rules\nWe've added clear rules around the types of\nimages that can be uploaded to Pitch, ensuring\nthat images will load reliably across nearly all\nbrowsers.\nYou can upload any JPEG, GIF, SVG, or PNG\nunder 50MB via the web or desktop app without\nissue. If you try to upload a different format,\nwe'll kindly remind you that it's unsupported.\n\nJPEG · GIF · SVG · PNG\n\n\u003c50MB\n\nImprovement\n\nNavigate template picker with\narrow keys\nKeyboard lovers, we know you're all about\nspeed.\nBefore, when creating a new presentation, you\ncould only use your left and right arrow keys to\ntraverse the template picker. Now we've\nunlocked the power of your up and down\narrows, so you can shave off a few milliseconds\ntyping your way to the right template.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🚨 Alerts won't appear during presentation mode.\n\nWhen you start working of ine in Pitch, we display an alert letting you know\nwhen changes last synced. This is helpful while editing content, less helpful\nwhen presenting. This alert is now disabled while in presentation mode, so\nyour content remains the star of the show.\n\n💅 Changes to a presentation style's general settings will apply right away.\n\nBefore, changing any of the general settings in the style builder — like\nbackground color or font family — didn't work as expected. Changes wouldn't\nbe visible in the right-hand preview until one clicked through the reset\nbuttons. From now on, changes will appear right away.\n\n🔗 Lists and links won't be affected when resetting text blocks.\n\nWe no longer treat lists and hyperlinks as inline formatting. So if you\nclick Reset to default in the right-hand panel, the fonts, colors, and sizes will\nreset to match the active presentation style, but any lists and hyperlinks will\nstay put.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n📩 Templates can no longer be shared.\n\nWith this change, you can't make content in your Templates folder public or\ninvite external collaborators to edit templates. This is for the best, as\ntemplates work a bit differently — any changes made rst need to be\npublished. Sharing for individual presentations in your workspace remains\nunchanged.\n\n👽 Additional spaces in text blocks will be preserved while editing.\n\nBefore, if you clicked to edit a text block with multiple spaces in a row, the\nspaces would be lost. Clicking out of the text block would show the original\nformatting. We're not here to tell you how many spaces to put between\nsentences (though, for the record, it's de nitely just one space). If you insist on\nmultiple spaces, we'll keep them where they are.\n\n🔤 Selecting an area of the slide won't generate a text block.\n\nSometimes, selecting an area of the slide with your mouse and then releasing\nwould result in an accidental text block. And now it won't.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n✈ Resized text won't\n\now into the \"no- y zone.\"\n\nWe now constrain the width of text blocks positioned near the no- y zone;\ni.e., the gridlines near the edges of the slide canvas. Before, if you placed text\nalong the gridlines and increased the font size, the text would ow off the\ncanvas. Now it will wrap and move down, but never off, the right side of the\nslide.\nTables can be resized using the right-hand panel.\n\n📏\n\nBefore, you could drag a table to adjust the width and height, but entering the\ndimensions directly in the right-hand panel did nothing. Now you can change\nthe dimensions by directly inputting the desired width and height.\n\n🎨 Custom templates should be back in your Templates folder.\n\nA small selection of custom templates (i.e., ones created and saved by users,\nnot pre-loaded by Pitch) were available via the template picker when creating\na new presentation, but missing from the Templates folder. We've xed this\nbug, and those templates should now be available in both spots.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"There's a template for that","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover-whats-new-aug-25-1-.png","date":"2020-08-26","tags":["Templates","Editor"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/6e8968c9-6d3d-4b70-a420-1ae69934549a?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover-whats-new-aug-25-1-.png","announcements":1,"improvements":4,"bugs":4,"marketingCopy":"Almost anything has the potential to be a great presentation.

For now, keep these initial rules\nin mind:\n• Smart Tidying is only available for blocks of the same\ntype (e.g., all text blocks, all shapes, etc.)\n• All objects need to be overlapping in some way.\n\n✨\n\nNew Feature\n\nUpdated inline editor\n\n✨\n\nInline text styling is getting even better. We've\nintroduced a new editor that makes it easier to\nadjust the look and feel of text.\nBefore today, you could use the inline editor to\nbold, italicize, underline, strike through or\nhyperlink text.

You\ncan now add gradients to slide backgrounds so\nthat your slides look as brilliant as your ideas.\nTo add a gradient, deselect all blocks and select\nthe drop-down next to Background Color in the\nright-hand panel. Select Background Gradient,\nthen:\n• Choose a start color\n• Choose a stop color\n• Adjust the rotation of your gradient\n\nImprovement\n\nMore performance\nimprovements\nEven more\n\nPERFORMANCE\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nAnother week, another round of performance\noptimizations!\n• Typing. We're down to two milliseconds to process\nevery keystroke.\n• Real-time collaboration. Editing content with others\nshould be seamless. Now you shouldn't experience\nany interruptions if a team member edits a slide while\nyou're working on it.\n\nImprovement\n\nUpdates to public sharing\nWe've improved the process of sharing your\npresentations with the world.\nWhenever you toggle on Public Access, the UI\nwill update immediately, so who can access your\npresentations is always clear. If for some reason\nwe can't publicly share your presentation, you'll\nreceive a pop-up noti cation with an option to\nretry.\n\nImprovement\n\nSticky sub-headers in the\neditor\nLast week we introduced sticky headers. These\nwere intended to provide additional context\nwhen editing blocks, browsing templates, or\ncollaborating with others.\nWith our latest updates, sub-headers are also\nsticky. This is particularly useful when it comes\nto the Library view, so you always know which\ntemplate you're checking out.\n\nImprovement\n\nNew rules for What's New\nThis very presentation you're reading has also\nreceived some updates. Meta, right?\nUp until this week, the What's New pop-up\nwould show up everywhere as soon as an update\nwas available. We've adjusted the rules so that\nworkspace members only receive a noti cation\nwhen exploring a workspace or editing a\npresentation.\nThat means we'll never disturb you — or your\naudience — when content is being actively\npresented.\n\nNEW!\n\nImprovement\n\nSVG images supported across\nweb and desktop app\nMany of our early users prefer to use SVGs over\nPNGs or JPGs when building out company\npresentations. Hey, we like SVGs too!\nAs a symbol of our admiration, they will now\ndisplay correctly across our web and desktop\napps.\n\nImprovement\n\nBetter rules for table sizes\nWe've added rules for table sizes so that they're\neasier to work with and manipulate.\nTable cells now have a minimum height and\nwidth based on the content within. That means\nthat when dragging to resize, you can never go\nbeyond the set rules.\n\n✨\n\n✨\n\nBug Fixes\n\nDuplicating blocks using keyboard shortcuts will preserve block order\nUsing CMD+C and CMD+V (or CTRL+C and CTRL+V) or ALT + drag to duplicate\nblocks will preserve the order of blocks. Duplicated blocks will always appear\non top of their original.\nThe selection frame for new text blocks will match the size of the text block\nWhen creating a new text block, the selection frame around the text would\noftentimes be larger than the actual text itself.

Well, people talk. And oftentimes\nabout money.\nOur nancial report template will\nhelp your people talk about money. The style is\nclean, professional, and gives you ideas on how\nto visualize budgets and discuss your nancial\nplans.\nWe've added this template directly to your\nworkspace. You can nd it in the template picker\nwhen you go to create a new presentation, or via\nthe template panel in your editor.\n\nTemplates\n\nUX research template\n99% of people agree that research is super\nduper important.*\nThis template gives you a way to introduce\nresearch ndings, visualize a customer journey,\nand run an internal workshop (complete with a\nvariety of dot colors for all your dot-voting\nneeds). The style is fresh, modern, and easy to\ncustomize using your brand's presentation\nstyle.\nWe've added this template directly to your\nworkspace. You can nd it in the template picker\nwhen you go to create a new presentation, or via\nthe template panel in your editor.\n*citation needed, but it's probably true!\n\nNew Feature\n\nText placeholders for new slides\nQuickly get ideas out onto a slide with text\nplaceholders.\nWhen you add a new slide, you'll see a title\nplaceholder up top and can start typing away.\nPressing ⌘ + return (CTRL + enter on Windows)\nwill add a line or normal text directly\nbelow. Typing ⌘ + shift + return (CTRL + shift\n\n- enter on Windows) will create a new slide.\nUsed in conjunction with our new keyboard\nshortcuts, you can create deck outlines faster\nthan ever.\n\nImprovement\n\nSpelling suggestions\nIt's happened to all of us: You spend weeks\nworking on a deck only to notice a typo midpresentation. Ugh.\nWe're excited to help you eliminate errors with\nan upgrade to our spellcheck. When editing a\ntext block, misspelled words will be underlined\nin red. Right click to reveal a list of suggestions\nand select the right word. This is only available in\nour desktop app for now.\nNot using the desktop app yet? Download Pitch\nfor macOS or Windows.\n\nImprovement\n\nMinimum text size reduced to 8\nteeny tiny text!\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might\nwant to use eight-point font in a presentation:\nfootnotes, ne print, exing on your far-sighted\ncoworkers...\nWhatever your reason, you can now add teenytiny text in Pitch. Though the font size eld\nshows 24 as the lowest option, you can manually\nenter lower numbers.\n\nImprovement\n\nPerformance improvements\nWe're always looking for opportunities to shave\noff a few milliseconds. Pitch should help you feel\nfaster at every turn. Here are some of our latest\nimprovements.\n• Image loading has been optimized, which should help\nimage-heavy presentations load faster.\n• Switching between template previews in the righthand panel is faster than ever.\n\nIMPROVED\nperformance\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🎁 Text in tables will wrap properly while editing.\n\nFrom now on, long phrases of text will wrap when they reach the natural width\nof a table column, instead of extending across columns. As a company lled\nwith German speakers, we have one thing to say about that: ausgezeichnet!\n\n🏃 Presentations with very large GIFs will load faster.\n\nDue to a bug, presentations with multiple, large GIFs would load extremely\nslowly. We've optimized the code to fetch images in order of priority, resulting\nin speedier performance.\n\n🔠 Custom fonts will now be available in private folders.\n\nIn our excitement to get private folders into your hands, we didn't check to\nmake sure you could use your custom fonts. Fortunately, this was spotted and\nxed right away.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🙅 We'll let you know if you click on links to presentations you can't access.\n\nBefore, if you tried to open a presentation that you didn't have access to, Pitch\nwould open your dashboard, but not load the presentation or give you any\nhelpful information. Now, we'll let you know if the presentation is part of a\nworkspace you're not a member of, or if another user has made it private.\n\n⏳ Opening a presentation via a link won't result in an in nite spinner.\n\nOccasionally, clicking on a link to access a presentation would result in an\nin nite spinner. This was objectively a Not Good Thing, so we xed it. Now, if\nyou have access to a presentation and click on a link, it should open as\nexpected.\n\n✂ Slides will no longer appear cut off while in presenter mode.\n\nOur presenter mode will now use the same resizing logic as the slide canvas,\nmeaning slides should appear in full, no matter the screen dimensions.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🗂 Duplicated presentations will stay in the same folder.\n\nWhen duplicating a presentation, the new version would always go to your\ndashboard home. Now, if the original was in a folder, the duplicate will go\nthere too.\n\n📝 Titles of shared presentations will not appear editable to collaborators.\nIf you share a presentation from a private folder or with someone from\nanother workspace, only you can edit the title. However, if a collaborator\nhovered over the title, a caret would appear, hinting that the title could be\neditable. Now, the cursor will not change.\n\n🖨 PDFs exported while of ine will correctly show all images and gradients.\nExporting a PDF while of ine would break some of the formatting —\npreventing images from showing and gradients from displaying correctly.\nNow, you can safely export presentations while of ine.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🤗 Emoji-only workspace names are now supported.\n\nGood news, emoji a cionados: Pitch now supports emoji-only workspace\nnames. In fact, any non-alphanumeric characters should work. So whether you\nnd this news or ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯, we've got your back.\n\n😍\n\n📂 Dragging presentations in Safari won't grab the surrounding text.\n\nSafari users might have noticed that dragging a presentation into a folder\ndidn't just grab the presentation — it also grabbed text from the surrounding\ndocuments. Now, only the cover slide and title are draggable.\n\n🖲 Clicking on a link in presentation mode won't advance to the next slide.\nWhen viewing a presentation in presenter mode or via a public link, clicking\non a hyperlink would open the link while also advancing to the next slide.\nNow, only the link will open.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🌆 Image\n\nlters won't appear for image placeholders.\n\nWe've tweaked the design tab just a bit. Now, you'll only see a list of image\nlters once you've added an image to your slide.\n\n🛑 Clicking invite link to a removed presentation triggers an error message.\nBefore, users trying to accept an invitation to presentation that had since\nbeen removed would get caught with, as one of our users so eloquently put\nit, the spinning wheel of purple anticipation. Now, if this happens, you'll receive\nan error message with more information.\n\n🔤 Presentation style names can start with lowercase letters.\n\nPreviously, presentation style names that began with lowercase letters would\nappear in title case from the editor. Now, you'll see the lowercase name in the\npresentation styles overview and in the style builder.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🎇 New GIFs will look better and take up less bandwidth.\n\nFrom now on, animated GIFs will show original images instead of transcoded\nGIFs or WEBPs. Note that this only applies to GIFs uploaded after this\nrelease.\n\n⌨ Tabbing through the editor toolbar won't focus twice on each button.\n\nThis is straightforward enough. Using the tab key to rotate through buttons\non the editor toolbar will be zippier, as it will only focus on each button once\nbefore moving on.\n\n✏ New blocks added to slides will be selected and editable.\n\nAny time you add a new block — like text or an image — to a slide, it will be in a\nselected state so you can edit it. This also applies to our new text\nplaceholders: If you create a new slide, the text placeholder will be selected\nand editable so you can keep typing and typing and typing ...\n\nBug Fixes\n\n📋 Pasted slides will always show up under the current slide.\n\nPasting a slide while no slides were selected would result in the new slide\ngoing to the bottom of your deck. From now on, if no slides in the sidebar are\nselected, the pasted slide will appear below the slide you're currently\nviewing.\n\n👯 Copying text from one block and pasting it will work correctly.\n\nPreviously, newly pasted text blocks would have an incorrectly sized bounding\nbox, as well as a background color automatically applied.\n\n✂ Cutting text won't change the font size of the remaining text.\n\nNow, if you cut text from an existing text block, the remaining text will keep its\ncurrent font size. Before, the text immediately below the cut section would\nlook smaller.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n✔Keyboard shortcuts for bolding and italicizing text work consistently.\n\nBolding and italicizing text using your keyboard wasn't always working as\nexpected. For instance, if the headline text style was already using a bold font\nstyle, you couldn't unbold it. We've adjusted this so that you can bold and\nitalicize text any way you like.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Time to celebrate\u0026nbsp;\u0026#127881;","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/191002_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_fgdxyr.jpg","date":"2019-10-02","tags":["Workflow"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/3bb56093-ae68-42e3-9883-3c09c7697506?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/whats-new/191002_Weekly_Release_Notes_3200x1800_fgdxyr.jpg","announcements":1,"improvements":6,"marketingCopy":"Our first users have played an invaluable role in pressure-testing Pitch and preparing us to onboard users.

We xed it, so now, you can\ntype freely without distractions.\nAlso, when you hover over a style name, you will\nnow see a tooltip with the full name of the style.\nSuper helpful when you want to see a style name\nat a glance.\n\nImprovement\n\nFaster template selection\nWe want to make sure it's as easy as possible for\nyou to start creating beautiful presentations.\nNow, when you click on Create presentation,\nthe rst template will already be selected.\nAn added bonus: You can use your keyboard to\nquickly choose a template. Just navigate with\nthe TAB key and select with the ENTER key.\n\nImprovement\n\nSmarter Colors\nThe border color is now correctly labeled — it\nwas previously labeled Fill Color. Also, the\nselected color is now preserved when switching\nbetween a background color and background\ngradient.\nAn extra plus: If you switch to a gradient with a\ncolor selected, a complementary color for the\ngradient is automatically suggested.\n\nImprovement\n\nA few more improvements we made this week:\n\n⏰ Timestamps in email summary digests\n\nNext time you open up your summary digests, you'll be able to see the time\nwhen a comment or reply was posted.\n\n🚀 Improvements to the sign-in window\n\nLoading time is 2x faster, so getting into Pitch is quicker than ever and the\ndesign has been refreshed to look more native on both macOS and Windows.\nPlus, if you saw some weird ickering, rejoice, that's ickered out of existence.\n\n✌ More calmness in your workspace\n\nWhen you go back to your dashboard, the workspace switcher will already be\nin the right place, not jumping down from the top.

That's why we believe features, functionality, and even limits should be simple to understand. This week, you'll notice:\n* Smart swapping rules are clearer\n* Workspace templates are easier to access\n* Recently used colors are stored in the color picker","excerpt":"\nWeekly Release\nFebruary 4, 2020","slug":"/whats-new/tons-of-tweaks","content":"\nWeekly Release\nFebruary 4, 2020\n\n6 Improvements, 14 Bug Fixes\n\nTons of tweaks\n\nImprovement\n\nAdjusted swapping rules\nWe've updated the smart swapping rules to\nmake this feature easier to understand and use.\nTake a look on the left to see what's possible\nwith smart swapping!\nYou can now swap text of any size, as long as it\nshares the same appearance (like font, style, and\ncolor). The rules for images and shapes stay the\nsame: They should be the same type and of\nsimilar size.\n\nImprovement\n\nBetter image performance\nImages and GIFs will load much faster across\nboth the web and desktop apps!\nPerformance improvements should be especially\nnoticeable when using the desktop app. Before,\nloading images and other assets could result in a\nhigh CPU load, triggering the fan to kick in on\nMacs. Now the team at Pitch will be your\nnoisiest fans.\n\nBETTER\nimage performance\n\nImprovement\n\nUpdated template picker\nThe template picker has received a nice little\nmakeover.\nWe now promote your workspace's templates to\nthe top of the template picker so you can get\nstarted faster. Our custom-created templates\naren't going anywhere, though. You'll nd those\nin a new section below.\n\nImprovement\n\nMulti-tab support (web app)\nPitch now works across multiple browser tabs.\nSo go ahead, create a bunch of presentations at\nwork. Or copy off of a colleague's presentation.\n(Don't worry, we won't tell. )\n\n🤫\n\nIf you try to close or reload a tab before all\nchanges are synced in an active presentation,\nyou'll receive a helpful alert.\nYou might be asking: When will this awesomeness\ncome to the desktop app? Stay tuned!\n\nImprovement\n\nClearer presentation\npermissions\nWe love a tidy workspace. At Pitch, we're big\nfans of folders.\nHowever, there are still some limits to how much\nyou can tidy. For instance, if someone has shared\na presentation with you, you won't be able to\nmove that presentation into a folder. It's theirs\nto move, not yours. We've added an alert to clear\nthis up.\n\nImprovement\n\nInline text colors in color picker\nThe text color picker now includes your recently\nused inline text colors.\nNo more scurrying back to previous slides to\ncopy over the hex code. It'll be right there\nwaiting for you.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n💅 Accent colors in presentation styles will reliably adjust hyperlinks.\n\nDue to a bug, accent colors weren't re ected in hyperlinks. From now on, the\naccent colors in your presentation styles will always dictate the colors of\nhyperlinks and bullet points.\n\n🖼 Images can be panned multiple times.\n\nPanning an image (pressing shift + option and then dragging with your\nmouse) would stop working after the rst pan. Now you can pan as much as\nyou'd like. (Didn't know this option existed? Check out this brief video\nwalkthrough to learn more!)\n\n🏡 Presentations can be dragged back into the Home folder.\n\nHome is where the heart is, and where your presentations should be. For a\nshort while, there was a bug that prevented your presentations from going\nhome — speci cally to the Home folder in your dashboard.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔤 Custom fonts will display correctly across workspaces.\n\nBefore, if you created a presentation with custom fonts and then moved that\npresentation to another workspace, dashboard previews of your presentation\nwouldn't show the right font. With this x, your previews will match the fonts\nused in your presentation.\n\n🎨 Duplicate colors in text color picker are gone.\n\nNo, you weren't dealing with three very similar shades of black in the color\npicker. For a while, duplicate colors would show up in the text block color\npicker. We've removed these so that only unique colors are displayed.\n\n⬛\n\nshift + click will select and deselect blocks as expected.\n\nTyping shift and clicking on blocks to select multiple elements, or to deselect\nindividual ones, wasn't behaving consistently; i.e., some clicks did nothing.\nNow, every click has meaning. Isn't that comforting?\n\nBug Fixes\n\n💻 Text blocks will no longer paste as code inside tables.\n\nCopying an entire text block and then pasting it into a table cell would paste\nthe underlying code. Now you can copy the text block or select the text inside\n— both should paste perfectly.\n\n📋 Duplicated bulleted lists will contain the correct attributes.\n\nText blocks with bulleted lists would paste incorrectly if inline elements like\nfont were changed. The new blocks would contain errors like incorrect\nindentation or bullet colors. And now they don't!\n\n📜 Typing text that goes outside the slide area won't scroll the canvas.\n\nAdding and editing text outside of a slide's \"no- y zone\" would cause the\ncanvas to scroll, with no option to return to the normal view. You can still\nenter text that goes outside of a slide, if you really really want to, but the app\nwill no longer scroll to follow it.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖱 Right-click context menus will stay inside the window of the web app.\n\nThe right-click context menus will adjust — either moving menu options up or\ndown — to make sure nothing moves out of the web app.\n\n💬 Mentions popover in comments will have a max height.\n\nTyping @ to mention a collaborator in a comment would create a very long\npopover in large workspaces. This x ensures the popover has a max height.\n\n⌨ Placeholder text will be editable for new keyboard-created presentations.\nThis bug primarily affected keyboard shortcut users. When creating a new\npresentation from the keyboard and adding new slides, placeholder text\nwould be in a focused state, but not editable without rst using your mouse.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔢 Numbered lists will have the correct spacing.\n\nBefore, if you were making a long list (e.g., The top 12 things I love about Pitch),\nthe double-digit numbers would overlap with the text. Similarly, some\nmonospaced fonts would result in oddly spaced numbered lists. We've xed\nthis so you can create beautiful lists that go on, and on, and on ...\n\n⌨ Keyboard shortcuts will still work if selection area\n\nnishes off slide.\n\nIf you used your mouse to drag and select an object, keyboard shortcuts would\nbe disabled if the selection ended outside of the slide. That meant you couldn't\nuse your keyboard to delete, move, or otherwise change a block. With this x,\nkeyboard shortcuts will always work.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Track slide views for custom links","metaDescription":"March 2023 — What’s new in Pitch: With slide views you’ll know which slides catch your visitors’ attention and which ones they’ve missed.","metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1680590904/whats-new/Cover_-_April_2023.jpg","date":"2023-04-04","tags":["Sharing"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/86af8ce6-488f-490b-8ed7-4abc6754282f?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1680590904/whats-new/Cover_-_April_2023.jpg","imageDescription":"slide views in presentation analytics","features":1,"improvements":1,"bugs":7,"marketingCopy":"In March, we added slide views to presentation analytics, giving Pitch Pro users insights into how visitors consume their deck.

With\nkeyboard shortcuts, you can navigate your\nworkspaces, create presentations, add slides,\nand insert content without leaving your\nkeyboard.\nType ⌘ + K (or CTRL + K) to pull up the quick\nmenu, which lets you discover available\nkeyboard shortcuts and actions.\n\nQuick menu while editing presentation:\n\nNew Feature\n\nQuick menu and keyboard\nshortcuts (2/2)\nMost options in the quick menu offer a singleletter shortcut — like I for image or T for text.\nOther options have a submenu; for instance:\ntype S to pull up a menu of available shapes.\nThe quick menu will show different options\nbased on what you're doing in Pitch. While\nediting a presentation, you can add content.\nWhile in the dashboard, you can manage your\nworkspaces and invite users.\nWe have big plans for shortcuts, but need your\nfeedback. Let us know which ones you'd like to\nsee next!\n\nQuick menu while in dashboard:\n\nNew Feature\n\nEmail-password sign in\nYou can now create a password for your Pitch\naccount instead of signing in with Google. This\nalso means that we'll be able to open up our\nlimited preview to companies who don't use G\nSuite.\nIf you want to set a password for your current\nPitch account, go ahead! Just click Sign in with\nemail \u0026 password on the login screen. As long as\nyou're using the same email, we'll be able to tie\nyour identities together.\n\nNew Feature\n\nManage visibility of\npresentations (1/2)\nWe're giving you greater control over who can\nsee and edit the presentations in your team\nworkspace. With the new private space, you can:\n• Keep some presentations to yourself\n• Collaborate with a small group\n• Work through your ideas in private before\nsharing with the rest of your workspace\nPresentations created in your private space are\nonly visible to you. If you want to work with a\nfew other people, just use the normal invite\noptions. When you're ready to share with the\nfull team, just drag the presentation to your\nHome dashboard or a workspace folder.\n\nNew Feature\n\nManage visibility of\npresentations (2/2)\nThere are two ways to organize your private\npresentations.\nIn your private space\nIn your team workspace, you'll see a folder with\nyour full name. This is your default private space.\nIn a private folder\nWe've added a new section above the\nworkspace folders. Now you can create and\norganize your private or semi-private\npresentations in a folder, just like you do with\nother presentations.\nHave questions? We have answers — check out\nour FAQs.\n\nImprovement\n\nAdditional font weight support\nWe've been thrilled by the number of Pitch\nteams working with custom fonts to create\nbeautiful, on-brand presentations.\nDuring the process of uploading some fonts, we\nnoticed there were several font weights we\ndidn't yet support.\nThat limit has now been removed so you can\nwork with any font (in a .otf, .ttf, or .woff format)\nin Pitch. Interested in adding your font? Just\nemail the les to [support@pitch.com](mailto:support@pitch.com).\n\nImprovement\n\nAdded workspace tooltips\nNavigating between workspaces is faster and\neasier.\nHover over a workspace icon, and you'll see a\ndescriptive tooltip with the workspace name as\nwell as a number. You can use the numbers keys\nto switch between workspaces.\n\nImprovement\n\nRemoved slide statuses from\npublic presentations\nSlide statuses are a great way to signal to your\nteam whether content is being worked on or\nready to present. However, that information\nmight not be as relevant to external audiences.\nFrom now on, if you turn on public access for a\npresentation, people outside your workspace\nwon't see any slide statuses.\n\nImprovement\n\nMore slide assignees to choose\nfrom\nWork with outside collaborators more\neffectively. Now, anyone working on a\npresentation — that includes both workspace\nmembers as well as collaborators with edit\naccess — will show up in the list of available slide\nassignees.\n\nImprovement\n\nBetter image performance\nWe've taken several steps to improve the\nexperience of working with large images in Pitch.\n• When uploading an image in the web app, we'll show a\nsmall spinner to indicate that the upload is in\nprogress.\n• We'll automatically resize images across different\nparts of the app, making the whole experience a lot\nspeedier.\n• We've introduced advanced image-optimization\ntechniques to reduce le sizes.\n\nBETTER\nimage performance\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🔡 Text blocks will extend in the correct direction.\n\nWhen editing a text block, the text will extend as expected: left-aligned\nblocks will move to the right, right-aligned blocks will move to the left,\nand center-aligned blocks will extend in both directions.\n\n📋 Copied text blocks will never be pasted as code.\n\nCopying a text block in Pitch and pasting the content into another text block\nwill paste just the text, and not the underlying code.\n\n🔄 Inspector options won't reset when duplicating blocks.\n\nDid you know you can duplicate blocks like text, images, and shapes by\nholding OPTION or ALT and dragging the block with your mouse? It's very\nhandy. However, using this duplication method would temporarily reset the\ninspector options under the Design tab. With this x, the inspector options\nwill always re ect the selected block's settings.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖨 PDF export will work for presentations with GIFs.\n\nSeveral users reported that presentations with animated GIFs couldn't be\nexported as PDFs. From now on, we'll convert GIFs to still images during\nthe export process.\n\n🔗Hyperlinked text in comments is easier to see.\n\nInstead of pasting a URL into a comment, you can use the inline editor to\nhyperlink a selection of text. Now, when editing a comment, any\nhyperlinked text will be underlined and will keep its original line breaks.\n\n↪Rotated text blocks won't collapse into multiple lines when editing.\nRotated text blocks will now behave like normal text blocks when being\nedited. Just click to edit and type away.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n🖼 Uploaded images won't appear broken.\n\nDuring the process of uploading, image blocks would appear to be\nbroken. That is to say, the dreaded broken image icon would show up\ninstead of any loading indicator or the image. This has been xed, and you\nshould now see a preview of the image instead.\n\n📊 Chart and table control buttons won't be blocked by blocks.\n\nIf you were working on a busy slide, where charts and tables were close\nto other block types, you might have had a hard time adding a new row or\nselecting Edit chart data. Now, if you select a table or chart, the control\nbuttons will always appear on top of all other blocks, so you can easily\nedit content.\n"},{"type":"whats-new-item","isIndexed":true,"title":"Work smarter, not harder","metaDescription":null,"metaImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover-whats-new-sept-1.png","date":"2020-09-01","tags":["Collaboration","Tables","Workflow"],"presentation":"https://pitch.com/embed/a39cdfeb-fe61-4202-b1da-233152db844b?share=false","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website-images/uploads/cover-whats-new-sept-1.png","features":1,"improvements":4,"bugs":4,"marketingCopy":"Working in Pitch should feel effortless.

Find answers to all this and more in our [help center](https://help.pitch.com).","list":[{"question":"How do subscriptions work?","answer":"Pitch subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period (either monthly or yearly), and apply to a single workspace. When you add a member, you’ll pay for their seat from the moment they accept an invite to the workspace, unless they fill an empty seat. When you remove a member from your workspace, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews with the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"What happens if I add members to a workspace on a paid plan?","answer":"If you’re on a monthly plan, we’ll invoice you the next month, based on when you added the member. If you’re on a yearly plan, we’ll invoice you in the following month, based on when you added the member. Additional charges on the yearly plan will be invoiced once per month — so if you add multiple users throughout the month we’ll charge you in one invoice."},{"question":"Is there a time limit on the free plan?","answer":"No — you and your team can use the free plan for as long as you want."},{"question":"How many members can I have on the free plan?","answer":"You can have a total of 5 members in a Free workspace. All members will be admins, however, and have access to all workspace settings."},{"question":"What happens if I remove members from a workspace when I’m on a paid plan?","answer":"When you remove members, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews at the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?","answer":"Yes, you can pay either monthly or yearly. If you choose a yearly plan, you’ll get a discounted price for each seat."},{"question":"Can I invite people outside my organization to collaborate on presentations?","answer":"Yes, you can invite guests to comment on or edit individual presentations. Guests can only see presentations shared with them and will not be able to access other workspace content."},{"question":"Do I need to pay for guests?","answer":"No, but the number of guest seats depends on the plan you choose. You can always upgrade for more guests."},{"question":"What’s the difference between Free, Pro, and Business?","answer":"The Free plan is generous so you and a few friends can create stunning presentations at no cost. The Pro plan gives teams more creative options to deliver high-quality unbranded presentations with native videos, interactive embeds, and custom fonts, alongside workspace management, and some presentation analytics. The Business plan is designed for entire teams, especially those who rely on presentations to win work, since it includes unlimited advanced links."},{"question":"What is the commenter role?","answer":"The commenter role lets you add members to your workspace at no additional cost. They can view and comment on all presentations visible to everyone in your workspace. Commenters can’t edit or create presentations, however. They’re a good option when you need feedback from stakeholders, or use presentations to share information in your team."},{"question":"What are presentation analytics and advanced links?","answer":"Advanced links let you track slide views, time spent on slides, and other data when recipients open a link. They also let you require an email or passcode to access your presentation. Basic links let you share a presentation with rich animations and videos that’s always up to date, but don’t include analytics about your visitors’ activity or advanced sharing options."},{"question":"Is there a file storage limit for my workspace?","answer":"In normal use, you should be able to create and upload presentations and files in your Pitch workspace without having to worry about file storage.

Find answers to all this and more in our [help center](https://help.pitch.com).","list":[{"question":"How do subscriptions work?","answer":"Pitch subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period (either monthly or yearly), and apply to a single workspace. When you add a member, you’ll pay for their seat from the moment they accept an invite to the workspace, unless they fill an empty seat. When you remove a member from your workspace, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews with the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"What happens if I add members to a workspace on a paid plan?","answer":"If you’re on a monthly plan, we’ll invoice you the next month, based on when you added the member. If you’re on a yearly plan, we’ll invoice you in the following month, based on when you added the member. Additional charges on the yearly plan will be invoiced once per month — so if you add multiple users throughout the month we’ll charge you in one invoice."},{"question":"Is there a time limit on the free plan?","answer":"No — you and your team can use the free plan for as long as you want."},{"question":"How many members can I have on the free plan?","answer":"You can have a total of 5 members in a Free workspace. All members will be admins, however, and have access to all workspace settings."},{"question":"What happens if I remove members from a workspace when I’m on a paid plan?","answer":"When you remove members, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews at the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?","answer":"Yes, you can pay either monthly or yearly. If you choose a yearly plan, you’ll get a discounted price for each seat."},{"question":"Can I invite people outside my organization to collaborate on presentations?","answer":"Yes, you can invite guests to comment on or edit individual presentations. Guests can only see presentations shared with them and will not be able to access other workspace content."},{"question":"Do I need to pay for guests?","answer":"No, but the number of guest seats depends on the plan you choose. You can always upgrade for more guests."},{"question":"What’s the difference between Free, Pro, and Business?","answer":"The Free plan is generous so you and a few friends can create stunning presentations at no cost. The Pro plan gives teams more creative options to deliver high-quality unbranded presentations with native videos, interactive embeds, and custom fonts, alongside workspace management, and some presentation analytics. The Business plan is designed for entire teams, especially those who rely on presentations to win work, since it includes unlimited advanced links."},{"question":"What is the commenter role?","answer":"The commenter role lets you add members to your workspace at no additional cost. They can view and comment on all presentations visible to everyone in your workspace. Commenters can’t edit or create presentations, however. They’re a good option when you need feedback from stakeholders, or use presentations to share information in your team."},{"question":"What are presentation analytics and advanced links?","answer":"Advanced links let you track slide views, time spent on slides, and other data when recipients open a link. They also let you require an email or passcode to access your presentation. Basic links let you share a presentation with rich animations and videos that’s always up to date, but don’t include analytics about your visitors’ activity or advanced sharing options."},{"question":"Is there a file storage limit for my workspace?","answer":"In normal use, you should be able to create and upload presentations and files in your Pitch workspace without having to worry about file storage. We have a fair usage policy of 10GB total storage for Free workspaces, and 10GB per member on premium plans, to protect against abuse."}]},"logos":{"title":"Loved by teams around the

Find answers to all this and more in our [help center](https://help.pitch.com).","list":[{"question":"How do subscriptions work?","answer":"Pitch subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each billing period (either monthly or yearly), and apply to a single workspace. When you add a member, you’ll pay for their seat from the moment they accept an invite to the workspace, unless they fill an empty seat. When you remove a member from your workspace, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews with the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"What happens if I add members to a workspace on a paid plan?","answer":"If you’re on a monthly plan, we’ll invoice you the next month, based on when you added the member. If you’re on a yearly plan, we’ll invoice you in the following month, based on when you added the member. Additional charges on the yearly plan will be invoiced once per month — so if you add multiple users throughout the month we’ll charge you in one invoice."},{"question":"Is there a time limit on the free plan?","answer":"No — you and your team can use the free plan for as long as you want."},{"question":"How many members can I have on the free plan?","answer":"You can have a total of 5 members in a Free workspace. All members will be admins, however, and have access to all workspace settings."},{"question":"What happens if I remove members from a workspace when I’m on a paid plan?","answer":"When you remove members, they vacate their paid seat. You can fill an empty seat free of charge by adding a new member. If you don’t fill an empty seat by the end of the billing period, the subscription renews at the quantity of occupied seats."},{"question":"Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?","answer":"Yes, you can pay either monthly or yearly. If you choose a yearly plan, you’ll get a discounted price for each seat."},{"question":"Can I invite people outside my organization to collaborate on presentations?","answer":"Yes, you can invite guests to comment on or edit individual presentations. Guests can only see presentations shared with them and will not be able to access other workspace content."},{"question":"Do I need to pay for guests?","answer":"No, but the number of guest seats depends on the plan you choose. You can always upgrade for more guests."},{"question":"What’s the difference between Free, Pro, and Business?","answer":"The Free plan is generous so you and a few friends can create stunning presentations at no cost. The Pro plan gives teams more creative options to deliver high-quality unbranded presentations with native videos, interactive embeds, and custom fonts, alongside workspace management, and some presentation analytics. The Business plan is designed for entire teams, especially those who rely on presentations to win work, since it includes unlimited advanced links."},{"question":"What is the commenter role?","answer":"The commenter role lets you add members to your workspace at no additional cost. They can view and comment on all presentations visible to everyone in your workspace. Commenters can’t edit or create presentations, however. They’re a good option when you need feedback from stakeholders, or use presentations to share information in your team."},{"question":"What are presentation analytics and advanced links?","answer":"Advanced links let you track slide views, time spent on slides, and other data when recipients open a link. They also let you require an email or passcode to access your presentation. Basic links let you share a presentation with rich animations and videos that’s always up to date, but don’t include analytics about your visitors’ activity or advanced sharing options."},{"question":"Is there a file storage limit for my workspace?","answer":"In normal use, you should be able to create and upload presentations and files in your Pitch workspace without having to worry about file storage. We have a fair usage policy of 10GB total storage for Free workspaces, and 10GB per member on premium plans, to protect against abuse."}]},"logos":{"title":"Loved by teams around the world"},"excerpt":"","slug":"/pricing/us","content":"","variant":"us"}],"page":{"isIndexed":true,"announcement":{"title":"Introducing the complete pitching platform — now with shareable rooms for your deals.","cta":{"label":"See what's new","url":"https://pitch.com/blog/complete-pitching-platform"}},"type":"homepage","title":"Presentation software for fast-moving teams","customSlug":"/","metaDescription":"Pitch is the complete pitching platform that enables any team to quickly create sleek presentations that get results.

Can I still apply?","description":"Absolutely! While the Pitch application is written mostly with Clojure, we use lots of more widely-known libraries and languages (e.g. React.js) as well. Every engineer who joins without prior knowledge of Clojure can expect extensive mentorship, time, and resources to learn Clojure and our codebase before diving into the deep-end."},{"heading":"I am based in insert any country here - can I still apply?","description":"Yes, of course. Pitch wants to hire the best and brightest regardless of where they're based geographically. On occasion, teams have a preference for candidates whose working hours overlap with the rest of their team, but there is always flexibility."},{"heading":"Your headquarters are in Berlin - will I need to relocate to work at Pitch?","description":"No. While we do have an office in Berlin, physical presence there is 100% optional."},{"heading":"None of the open positions listed match my skills or interests? Can I send through a speculative application?","description":"Absolutely, feel free to [submit a speculative application](mailto:pitch-software@jobs.workablemail.com)."}]},{"heading":"After applying","questions":[{"heading":"When can I expect to hear back after applying?","description":"We do our best to get back to all applicants within one week of their applications. That being said, the application review process has lots of moving parts and depends on the availability of our hiring teams, holidays, and other unpredictable factors. We do our best, but appreciate your patience if it takes \u003e1 week to respond to you."},{"heading":"Should I expect tailored feedback if my application gets rejected?","description":"Given the high volume of applications we receive, it's not possible for us to give tailored feedback to candidates who aren't selected for first-stage interviews. If you do progress beyond the first-stage interview, however, we try to give specific, tailored feedback should there not be a fit."},{"heading":"How many stages are there to a typical interview process? How much time will I need to invest?","description":"The typical Pitch interview processes consists of the following steps, all of which are conducted remotely.\n1. Introductory call with a member of our Talent Acquisition team.\n2. Interview with 1-2 future team members\n3. Take-home practical assignment.\n4. Follow-up de-brief and Q\u0026A on practical assignment with your future team-mates.\n5. Final call with a senior leader in your team's area (e.g. CTO, VP Design, VP Sales, etc.)"},{"heading":"What happens with my personal data if my application is rejected?","description":"We process and store all data in accordance with GDPR standards. You can request to have your data deleted at any time after applying and we will action this request within 1-2 days."},{"heading":"What is the average duration of the recruitment process at Pitch?","description":"The average recruitment process lasts between 4-5 weeks to get through all the stages, although there's some variability depending on availability on both the hiring team and candidate side."}]},{"heading":"Working at Pitch","questions":[{"heading":"Pitch talks a lot about remote-work, but a lot of your employees seem to be based in Europe. Will I be at a disadvantage if I work for Pitch from outside of Europe?","description":"The short answer is 'no'. We practice asynchronous communication."},{"heading":"What does 100% remote look like for Pitch?","description":"Yes, one might miss having the office as an anchor, or the occasional water-cooler chat with colleagues. But 100% remote work doesn't have to be disengaged and disconnected! At Pitch, we put a lot of emphasis on connecting (not just about work!) through virtual coffee chats, catch-ups via Zoom (as and when needed)... and Slack shenanigans. Additionally, we are big fans of team offsites, yearly company get togethers, and Weekly Bulletins (our async alternative to All-Hands). We believe remote working empowers you to work autonomously and flexibly on something you believe in, and your colleagues are only a Slack away for a second opinion, cheering up, and various meme shenanigans."}]}]},"navigation":{"logoLabel":"Pitch","ctaLabel":"Sign up","ctaUrl":"https://app.pitch.com/?signup","loginLabel":"Log in ","loginUrl":"https://app.pitch.com/?login=true","navigationItems":[{"text":"Product","url":"/product","highlights":[{"text":"Product Overview","url":"/product","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1699605279/website-assets/navigation/Pitch_2.0_nav_menu_image_2.png","description":"See how Pitch works and explore features"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Discover Pitch","links":[{"text":"What’s New","url":"/whats-new"},{"text":"Integrations","url":"/integrations"},{"text":"Presentation Gallery","url":"/presentations"},{"text":"Download","url":"/download"},{"text":"Status","url":"https://status.pitch.com/"}]}]},{"text":"Use Cases","url":"/teams","highlights":[{"text":"Pitch for Teams","description":"Explore how your whole team can use Pitch","url":"/teams","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1721897704/website-assets/navigation/menu-teams.png"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Teams","links":[{"text":"Agencies","url":"/teams/agencies"},{"text":"Sales","url":"/teams/sales"},{"text":"Success","url":"/teams/customer-success"},{"text":"Marketing","url":"/teams/marketing"},{"text":"Designers","url":"/teams/design"}]},{"heading":"Decks","links":[{"text":"Presentation Maker","url":"/use-cases/presentation-maker"},{"url":"/use-cases/pitch-decks","text":"Pitch Decks"},{"text":"Sales Decks","url":"/use-cases/sales-decks"},{"text":"Team Meetings","url":"/use-cases/team-meetings"},{"text":"Board Decks","url":"/use-cases/board-decks"}]}]},{"text":"Templates","url":"/templates","highlights":[{"url":"/templates","text":"Presentation Templates","description":"Get 100+ customizable, expert-made designs","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/v1707410834/Nav_template_callout_1.png"}],"lists":[{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Pitch Decks","url":"/templates/collections/Pitch-deck"},{"text":"Business","url":"/templates/collections/Business"},{"url":"/templates/collections/Sales","text":"Sales"},{"text":"Startups","url":"/templates/collections/Startups"},{"text":"Professional","url":"/templates/collections/Professional"}]},{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Agency","url":"/templates/collections/Agency"},{"text":"Portfolio","url":"/templates/collections/Portfolio"},{"text":"Brand","url":"/templates/collections/Brand"},{"text":"Creative","url":"/templates/collections/Creative"},{"text":"Modern","url":"/templates/collections/Modern"}]},{"heading":"","links":[{"text":"Project Plan","url":"/templates/collections/Project-plan"},{"text":"Proposal","url":"/templates/collections/Proposal"},{"text":"Research","url":"/templates/collections/Research"},{"text":"Strategy","url":"/templates/collections/Strategy"},{"text":"Marketing","url":"/templates/collections/Marketing"}]}]},{"text":"Resources","url":"/blog","highlights":[{"text":"Blog","url":"/blog","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pitch-software/image/upload/f_auto/website/common/navigation/dropdown-blog.png","description":"Discover updates, best practices, and more"}],"lists":[{"heading":"Learn","links":[{"text":"Pitch to Win","url":"/pitch-to-win/2023"},{"text":"Academy","url":"/academy"},{"text":"Presentation Guide","url":"/guides/presentation/structure-your-presentation"},{"text":"Help Center","url":"https://help.pitch.com/en/"}]}]},{"text":"Pricing","url":"/pricing"}],"socials":{"label":"Follow Us","links":[{"name":"Twitter","url":"https://www.twitter.com/pitch"},{"name":"Facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/pitchhq"},{"name":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pitchhq"},{"name":"Instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/PitchHq"}]}},"signUp":{"heading":"Want to get early access and product updates?","success-notice":"Almost finished...
